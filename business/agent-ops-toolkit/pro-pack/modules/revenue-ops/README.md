# Revenue Ops Agent (Agent Toolkit module)

Goal: turn Agent Toolkit from "reliability plumbing" into a **profit-adjacent business module**.

## What it does
A lightweight operations agent for small teams/communities:
- Watches inbound channels (Discord/Slack)
- Flags leads + urgent issues
- Posts daily digest + action list
- Pulls RSS/news (Miniflux) for content ideas

## Who it’s for
- OpenClaw/Molt builders running a community, product, or service
- Founders who miss inbound messages and ship inconsistently

## Deliverables (what we ship)
- Playbooks (rules + templates)
- Setup guide (how to install skills + configure)
- Example “daily digest” format

## Success metrics
- Fewer missed leads (respond time)
- More consistent content output
- Less founder time spent triaging

## Skills to use (from openclawskills.io)
- discord
- slack
- miniflux-news

## Next build steps
1) Add a working reference config + prompts
2) Add a cron reminder to run a daily digest (no LLM spam)
3) Add an optional paid subscriber gate (USDC subscription) for access to module updates
