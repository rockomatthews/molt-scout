# Positioning: OpenClaw / Molt Agent Builders

## Who this is for
- People building agents with OpenClaw/Molt
- Shipping webhook-driven automations
- Getting wrecked by reliability and cost problems (missed events, retries, runaway LLM spend)

## The promise
**Boring reliability** + **spend control**.

## The differentiator
Not a new agent framework.
We ship the operational layer:
- signature verification
- idempotency + replay
- queues + retries
- budgets + circuit breakers
- structured logs + trace ids

## Why a token (utility only)
Token gates access to premium templates and provides an optional revenue-linked sink (buybacks funded by subscriptions). It’s a product token, not a meme.
