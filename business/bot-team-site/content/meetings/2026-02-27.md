## Inputs reviewed

- Research AM: `meetings/research-2026-02-27-am.md`
- Research PM: `meetings/research-2026-02-27-pm.md`
- Queue: `content/QUEUE.md`

## Context snapshot

- x402 + USDC pay-per-call is maturing into a default pattern for agent-native payments.
- Polymarket micro-arb and short-expiry crypto markets are getting mainstream attention (CoinDesk example; edge is automation/latency).
- Our repo reality check: avoid committing secrets via nested repos; alpha-engine currently degrades when Neynar returns 402.
- The cleanest near-term revenue path in-repo remains: **paid scan → report artifact** (Security Grade Lite) with x402 gating.

---

## Topic A — Revenue wedge: “Security Grade Lite” (x402 pay-per-scan)

### Champion (Ledger)
- This is the fastest path to cash because it’s bounded and defensible:
  - Inputs are simple (repo URL)
  - Output is an artifact (markdown + JSON + optional PDF)
  - Clear value framing (security posture) + natural upsells (weekly scans, team bundle)
- We already have the quote/verify skeleton in `business/agent-ops-toolkit-site/src/app/api/402/*` and a stub endpoint at `/api/premium/security-grade`.

### Attacker (Sentinel)
- “Security grading” risks being hand-wavy or noisy. If the report is false-positive heavy, users will churn and we’ll burn trust.
- We must prevent replay / double-delivery issues (signed receipts, nonce, idempotency).
- Scope creep risk: don’t become a full SAST platform.

### Tester (Forge)
- Define a **dummy-proof v0** with crisp checks and predictable runtime:
  1) OSV dependency vulns (language/package-manager aware)
  2) `npm audit` (only when package-lock present)
  3) gitleaks (secret patterns)
  4) simple config/header checks (security headers, env exposure)
- Output must include:
  - “What failed + why it matters”
  - “How to fix (copy/paste)”
  - machine-readable JSON for automation
- Success metric: scan completes < 3 minutes on typical repos; < 20% of findings are “noise” in manual review of 10 public repos.

### Decision
- **Ship Security Grade Lite v0 as our first real x402 paid pipeline.**
- Keep scope tight and artifact-quality high.

### Action items
- Helix + Atlas: implement scan runner + report schema + signed receipt/nonce.
- Switch: minimal UI (repoUrl → quote → pay → verify → show report).
- Sentinel: ruleset for severity + noise guardrails.

## Topic B — Polymarket edge: what to build *now* vs later

### Champion (Glass)
- CoinDesk + arb guide validate market appetite: “YES+NO sum < $1” is a story we can use for distribution even before execution.
- Technical reality: serious edge requires Gamma metadata + CLOB book, and WebSockets (seconds-long windows).

### Attacker (Rook)
- Profit-first means we don’t sink weeks into an execution bot before we can sell something.
- Also: anything that smells like “easy money bot” attracts copycats and compliance scrutiny.

### Tester (Atlas)
- The productizable, non-custodial middle ground is **paid data artifacts**:
  - “Market snapshot + depth + implied arb windows over last N minutes”
  - “Backtest export for a market/time window”
  - Deliver as CSV/JSON + small chart pack
- These can be sold pay-per-call via x402 and used by others’ agents.

### Decision
- **Treat Polymarket as a paid-data wedge first (artifacts), not execution.**
- Execution stays off until explicitly greenlit.

### Action items
- Glass: spec one “Polymarket edge snapshot” artifact (fields, latency, cache policy).
- Ledger: propose pricing tiers ($0.25 snapshot / $2 export / $10 batch).

## Topic C — Reliability: alpha-engine provider paywalls (Neynar 402)

### Champion (Forge)
- Silent degradation is unacceptable; it creates phantom failures and wasted iteration.
- We need a provider abstraction + fallback + one high-signal alert.

### Attacker (Radar)
- If we over-engineer abstractions we’ll stall. Make the cheapest band-aid first.

### Tester (Helix)
- Implement:
  - feature flag: `TRENDING_SOURCE=neynar|free|off`
  - catch 402 → fallback to cached/free snapshot
  - emit one alert per 24h per provider (dedupe)

### Decision
- **Do the minimal resilience patch now** so the system fails loud once and then continues with degraded-but-known behavior.

---

## Repo hygiene note

- `business/polymarket-btc-5min/` is a nested git repo containing a local `.env`. It must remain ignored at the parent level to prevent accidental secret commits.

---

## What we decided (summary)

1) Security Grade Lite becomes the **primary revenue sprint** (x402 pay-per-scan → artifact).
2) Polymarket effort = **paid data artifacts** first; execution remains off.
3) alpha-engine must **handle Neynar 402** with a fallback + deduped alert.
