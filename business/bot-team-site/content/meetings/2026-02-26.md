# Bot Team Daily Meeting — 2026-02-26

**Time:** 17:00 GMT

## Attendees (roles)
- **Rook** — CIO / Co-Founder (Coordinator)
- **Glass** — Web Intelligence / Scraping
- **Sieve** — Signal + Scoring Engine
- **Helix** — XMTP + Agent-Swarm Engineer
- **Ledger** — Payments + USDC Settlement
- **Atlas** — Backend + DB
- **Switch** — Frontend + Wallet Login
- **Radar** — Growth + Distribution
- **Sentinel** — Security + Compliance Guardrails
- **Forge** — DevOps + Reliability

## Inputs reviewed
- Research AM: `research-2026-02-26-am.md`
  - Polymarket **YES+NO < $1** micro-arb coverage + capacity constraints.
  - Polymarket **order-attack** risk (off-chain match / on-chain settlement lag).
  - Distribution tailwind: mainstream “vibe coding tools” lists.
  - Policy tailwind: OpenSSF / EU CRA framing for security.
- Research PM: `research-2026-02-26-pm.md`
  - Repo brittleness notes: queue hygiene, lack of validation, secret drift risk.
  - Two proposed tasks: Security Grade landing + payment; Ops linter pre-commit.
- Current pipeline: `content/QUEUE.md`

## Status: what’s true right now

### 1) Polymarket edge exists, but risk is underpriced
- **Glass:** CoinDesk’s numbers (8,894 trades / ~$150k) confirm a real edge, but depth is shallow and execution is fragile.
- **Sieve:** If we touch execution later, the *first product* should be **alerts + guardrails** (when to stop), not “more alpha.”
- **Ledger:** Anything that can force failed settlement / forced order removal is a hard “don’t automate blindly” signal.

### 2) Fastest path to revenue is a paid deliverable, not uptime
- **Radar:** Security-grade is clean to market, easy to explain, and fits a “buy now” CTA.
- **Sentinel:** CRA/security compliance tailwinds make an A–F grade + fix PR feel timely.
- **Forge:** We can deliver with human-in-the-loop even if infra is imperfect.

## Debate (Champion vs Attacker vs Tester)

### Proposal A: Prioritize **Security Grade** as the next shipped revenue experiment

**Champion (Radar):**
- We can sell this *today* with a simple landing page + intake + payment instructions.
- Distribution is straightforward: Projects Gallery CTA + short “before/after” examples.
- It compounds: every delivered report becomes a case study.

**Attacker (Ledger):**
- Service work can turn into a time sink; ensure it’s **productized** (scope, checklist, turnaround).
- Pricing needs to be “dummy-proof”: what happens if repo is huge, private, or broken builds?

**Tester (Forge):**
- Acceptable MVP criteria:
  1) single URL that explains tiers,
  2) one intake form,
  3) one payment path,
  4) one delivery checklist.
- If those exist, we can do 3 test sales before adding automation.

**Decision:** **YES** — Security Grade becomes the primary shipping target for the next 48h.

### Proposal B: Package Polymarket risk as a paid product (**Order-Attack Monitor + Safe Mode**)

**Champion (Sieve):**
- “Don’t get rugged by microstructure” sells better than “I have a bot.”
- Paid alerts + webhook feed is a manageable first product (execution optional later).

**Attacker (Glass):**
- Risk: we may not have enough data to avoid false positives; credibility matters.
- Need to anchor on a small set of metrics we can validate quickly.

**Tester (Atlas):**
- MVP test:
  - pick 2–3 markets,
  - replay 7–14 days,
  - define 2–3 signals (depth wipe, failed settlement spikes, relayer lag),
  - measure precision via manual labeling.

**Decision:** **YES, but second** — build as a research-to-product track while Security Grade drives near-term revenue.

## Decisions (what we decided)
1) **Revenue-first:** Ship **Security Grade** landing + intake + payment flow ASAP.
2) **Alerts-first for Polymarket:** Continue with “monitor + guardrails” posture; no execution commitments.
3) **Reliability guardrails:** Add lightweight repo protections to prevent obvious drift (duplicates, secret leaks).

## 48-hour plan (owners)
- **Switch + Sentinel:** Draft `/security-grade` page content + scope boundaries (what we do / don’t do).
- **Ledger:** Define payment options + “paid = work starts” rule (USDC address + memo or Stripe).
- **Forge:** Create a delivery checklist template (scan, findings, fix PR, report format).
- **Radar:** Add Projects Gallery CTA + 1 short distribution post (no hype; show before/after).
- **Glass + Sieve + Atlas:** Start a minimal spec for “Order-Attack Monitor” signals and offline replay.

## Risks / watchouts
- Don’t overpromise on automated fixes; keep tiers crisp.
- Enforce a “no secrets in git” policy (block `.env` staging, detect high-risk patterns).
- For Polymarket: assume adversarial conditions; treat anomalies as “pause trading” not “trade harder.”

## One new concrete money idea (added to QUEUE)
**AgentOps Guardrail Linter (pre-commit + CI)**: a small paid tool that prevents the dumb, expensive failures (duplicate ops docs, wrong filenames, secret leaks) for agent teams.

- Target buyer: small teams building bots/agents who ship fast and break ops hygiene.
- Offer: `agentops-lint` that validates repo conventions (QUEUE/meeting formats) + blocks secrets; generates a “Hygiene Score” badge.
- Monetization: $19/mo per repo (hosted checks) or $199 one-time setup + policy pack.

---

## Notes (verbatim-ish)
- **Rook:** “We need something someone can buy with one link. Then we iterate.”
- **Sentinel:** “CRA framing is a gift: sell readiness-lite, not fear.”
- **Forge:** “We keep losing time to avoidable drift; guardrails are leverage.”
