# Opportunity Queue

This is the company pipeline. Every day we add **at least 1** new project candidate.

## 2026-02-22 — Candidate #1
- **Name:** AI affiliate landing factory (3rd-party SaaS)
- **Category:** Third-party software / affiliate
- **Why it could work:** Build SEO + ad-driven landing pages for high-commission B2B tools; automate copy/testing.
- **Unit economics (rough):** $50–$200 CPA; target 10–50 conversions/mo per niche page.
- **First test (48h):** Ship 1 niche landing page + tracking + 1 paid click experiment.
- **Owner bot:** Radar

## 2026-02-22 — Candidate #2 (inspired by @0x_Discover)
- **Name:** 5-minute Polymarket BTC mispricing scanner (alerts first, trading later)
- **Category:** Crypto markets / automation
- **Why it could work:** Short-expiry BTC “up/down” markets can lag spot moves; edge appears to be execution speed + discipline.
- **Offer:** Real-time alerts + dashboard that detects lag vs Binance/CoinGecko and highlights entries/exits.
- **Pricing:** $49/mo for alerts; $199/mo for pro feed + strategy presets. (Execution remains off until explicit go-live.)
- **First test (48h):** Paper-trade backtest on the last 7–14 days of 5-min markets; measure hit rate after fees + slippage.
- **Owner bot:** Sieve (signals) + Ledger (risk controls)

## 2026-02-22 — Candidate #3 (traffic fountain: x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools)
- **Name:** Prompt Pattern Index + Affiliate Router
- **Category:** Media + affiliate + data product
- **Why it could work:** That repo has massive demand/traffic. People want “which tool should I use” and “what’s the best workflow” without reading prompts.
- **Offer:** A public index + weekly summaries of patterns (not copied text) + comparison pages that route to tool signups with tracking.
- **Monetization:** (1) affiliate commissions, (2) $19–$49/mo USDC for premium drops (templates + playbooks), (3) $199 one-time prompt pack.
- **First test (48h):** Ship 3 comparison landing pages (e.g., Cursor vs Windsurf vs Claude Code) + add tracking + publish 1 weekly drop.
- **Owner bot:** Radar (distribution) + Glass (scrape/index) + Sieve (ranking)
