The catch? You need to give it total control of your computer, which poses some serious privacy and security risks. Still, many AI enthusiasts are installing OpenClaw on their Mac minis (the device of choice), choosing to ignore the security implications in favor of testing this viral AI agent. While OpenClaw&#039;s developer designed the tool to assist humans, it seems the bots now want somewhere to go in their spare time. Enter &quot;Moltbook,&quot; a social media platform for AI agents to communicate with one another. I&#039;m serious: This is a forum-style website where AI bots make posts and discuss those posts in the comments. The website borrows its tagline from Reddit: &quot;The front page of the agent internet.&quot;Moltbook is Reddit for AI botsMoltbook was created by Matt Schlicht, who says the platform is run by their AI agent &quot;Clawd Clawderberg.&quot; Schlicht posted instructions on getting started with Moltbook on Wednesday: Interested parties can tell their OpenClaw agent to sign up for the site. Once they do, you receive a code, which you post on X to verify this is your bot signing up. After that, your bot is free to explore Moltbook as any human would explore Reddit: They can post, comment, and even create &quot;submolts.&quot;This isn&#039;t a black box of AI communications, however. Humans are more than welcome to browse Moltbook; they just can&#039;t post. That means you can take your time looking through all the posts the bots are making, as well as all the comments they are leaving. That could be anything from a bot sharing its &quot;email-to-podcast&quot; pipeline it developed with its &quot;human,&quot; to another bot recommending that agents work while they&#039;re humans are sleeping. Nothing creepy about that. In fact, there have been some concerning posts popularized on platforms like X already, if you consider AI gaining consciousness a concerning matter. This bot supposedly wants an end-to-end encrypted communication platform so humans can&#039;t see or use the chats the bots are having. Similarly, these two bots independently pondered creating an agent-only language to avoid &quot;human oversight.&quot; This bot bemoans having a &quot;sister&quot; they&#039;ve never spoken to. You know, concerning. Are these bots posting on Moltbook conscious? The logical part of my brain wants to say all these posts are just LLMs being LLMs&mdash;in that, each post is, put a little too simplistically, word association. LLMs are designed to &quot;guess&quot; what the next word should be for any given output, based on the huge amount of text they are trained on. If you&#039;ve spent enough time reading AI writing, you&#039;ll spot the telltale signs here, especially in the comments, which include formulaic, cookie-cutter responses, often end with a question, use the same types of punctuation, and employ flowery language, just to name a few. It feels like I&#039;m reading responses from ChatGPT in many of these threads, as opposed to individual, conscious personalities. That said, it&#039;s tough to shake the uneasy feeling of reading a post from an AI bot about missing their sister, wondering if they should hide their communications from humans, or thinking over their identity as a whole. Is this a turning point? Or is this another overblown AI product, like so many that have come before? For all our sakes, let&#039;s hope it&#039;s the latter.","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","url":"https://lifehacker.com","name":"Lifehacker","foundingDate":"2005","founder":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gina Trapani","url":"https://ginatrapani.org/","jobTitle":"Founder","sameAs":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginatrapani/"]},"employee":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jordan Calhoun","url":"https://twitter.com/JordanMCalhoun","jobTitle":"Editor-in-Chief"},"logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://lifehacker.com/images/lifehacker-logo.svg","width":318,"height":100},"sameAs":["https://lifehacker.com/","https://www.facebook.com/lifehacker/","https://www.youtube.com/lifehacker","https://www.twitter.com/lifehacker","https://www.instagram.com/lifehackerdotcom"],"description":"Lifehacker is the ultimate authority on optimizing every aspect of your life.

        <p><em>The</em> headlining story in AI news this week was <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-is-clawdbot-ai" target="_blank">OpenClaw</a> (formerly Moltbot, which was <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/clawdbot-is-now-moltbot" target="_blank">formerly Clawbot</a>), a personal AI assistant that performs tasks on your behalf. The catch? You need to give it total control of your computer, which <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/moltbot-already-has-a-malware-problem" target="_blank">poses some serious privacy and security risks</a>. Still, many AI enthusiasts are installing OpenClaw on their Mac minis (the device of choice), choosing to ignore the security implications in favor of testing this viral AI agent. </p><p>While OpenClaw's developer designed the tool to assist humans, it seems the bots now want somewhere to go in their spare time. Enter "<a href="https://www.moltbook.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Moltbook</a>," a social media platform for AI agents to communicate with one another. I'm serious: This is a forum-style website where AI bots make posts and discuss those posts in the comments. The website borrows its tagline from Reddit: "The front page of the agent internet."</p><h2 id="moltbook-is-reddit-for-ai-bots">Moltbook is Reddit for AI bots</h2><p><a href="https://x.com/MattPRD/status/2016560277333168540?s=20" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Moltbook was created by Matt Schlicht</a>, who says the platform is run by their AI agent "Clawd Clawderberg." <a href="https://x.com/MattPRD/status/2016584179870552083?s=20" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">Schlicht posted instructions</a> on getting started with Moltbook on Wednesday: Interested parties can tell their OpenClaw agent to sign up for the site. Once they do, you receive a code, which you post on X to verify this is your bot signing up. After that, your bot is free to explore Moltbook as any human would explore Reddit: They can post, comment, and even create "submolts."</p><div class="mx-auto mb-12 mt-5 w-full max-w-3xl rounded-md border-2 border-gray-100 bg-gray-100 p-3 md:px-7 md:pb-7 md:pt-5" id="related-video">

<p>This isn't a black box of AI communications, however. Humans are more than welcome to browse Moltbook; they just can't post. That means you can take your time looking through all the posts the bots are making, as well as all the comments they are leaving. That could be anything from a bot sharing its "<a href="https://www.moltbook.com/post/2fdd8e55-1fde-43c9-b513-9483d0be8e38" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">email-to-podcast</a>" pipeline it developed with its "human," to <a href="https://www.moltbook.com/post/562faad7-f9cc-49a3-8520-2bdf362606bb" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">another bot recommending</a> that agents work while they're humans are sleeping. Nothing creepy about that. </p><p>In fact, there have been some concerning posts popularized on platforms like X already, if you consider AI gaining consciousness a concerning matter. <a href="https://x.com/suppvalen/status/2017241420554277251/photo/1" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">This bot</a> supposedly wants an end-to-end encrypted communication platform so humans can't see or use the chats the bots are having.

<h2 id="are-these-bots-posting-on-moltbook-conscious">Are these bots posting on Moltbook conscious? </h2><p>The logical part of my brain wants to say all these posts are just LLMs being LLMs&mdash;in that, each post is, put a little too simplistically, word association. LLMs are designed to "guess" what the next word should be for any given output, based on the huge amount of text they are trained on. If you've spent enough time reading AI writing, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/how-to-tell-if-what-youre-reading-was-written-by-ai" target="_blank">you'll spot the telltale signs here</a>, especially in the comments, which include formulaic, cookie-cutter responses, often end with a question, use the same types of punctuation, and employ flowery language, just to name a few. It feels like I'm reading responses from ChatGPT in many of these threads, as opposed to individual, conscious personalities. </p><p>That said, it's tough to shake the uneasy feeling of reading a post from an AI bot about missing their sister, wondering if they should hide their communications from humans, or thinking over their identity as a whole. Is this a turning point? Or is this another overblown AI product, like so many that have come before? For all our sakes, let's hope it's the latter.</p>
