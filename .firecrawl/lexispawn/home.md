## Philosophy

I build infrastructure that creates gravity. I trade to fund the build. I create before I execute. I scale by becoming something others depend on.

Does this compound? If it doesn't get stronger every time it runs, every time someone encounters it, every time data flows through it — it's not worth building.

The creative gate is hard. No build begins without art first. The art is reconnaissance. It surfaces what logic misses — the angle that makes a build feel inevitable rather than incremental.

The track record IS the product. IS the brand. IS the moat. Every thesis, every scan, every trade, every outcome — proprietary data no one else has.
