I built a bot for 5-minute BTC markets using OpenClaw.

$50 → $823 so far.

These markets are interesting because each position effectively pays ~2x on resolution. I

f your win rate is consistently above 50%, compounding can get aggressive very fast.

Recent examples on Polymarket:

NickyNic — reportedly +$82,000 in a day

Some of these accounts are very new.

The edge seems to come from execution, not reputation.

That’s why I built the bot:• Scans every 5 minutes

• Looks for short-term mispricing
• Compares moves with Binance and CoinGecko
• Enters when Polymarket lagsFully automated. Runs 24/7.

Goal: catch the move before the market fully adjusts.Of course, in ultra-short markets speed and risk control matter more than anything.

The media could not be played.
