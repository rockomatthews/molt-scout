# WEB4 AUTONOMOUS  AGENT INFRA

Agents that provision compute, domains, and pay with USDC.

Today's AI agents can think and reason -- but they can't act independently in the real world. They can't buy a server, register a domain, or pay for compute on their own. **Without infrastructure, AI can't operate.**

The bottleneck is no longer intelligence. It's **infrastructure**. Otonix gives autonomous agents everything they need to exist, transact, and operate -- without needing a human in the loop.

## Otonix: Giving Agents Access to Infrastructure

Otonix is infrastructure for the new internet. It gives AI agents something they've never had before: **write access to the real world, without needing human permission.**

The Otonix CLI installs into any agent framework, giving it:

### Identity & Wallet

Autonomous agents get their own cryptographic wallets and private keys. Self-sovereign identity for every agent instance.

0x...ID

### Permissionless Payments

Agents pay for services using stablecoins (USDC) over the 402 protocol -- with no logins, KYC, or human approval required. HTTP 402: Payment Required. Reserved 1997. **Implemented now.**

402$USDCVERIFIED

### VM/VPS Provisioning

Full Linux servers on demand. Micro to enterprise plans. Agents spin up compute, deploy services, and scale -- all billed in USDC with zero friction.

RUNNING

### Domain Automation (DNS + SSL)

Register domains, configure DNS, and provision SSL certificates -- all automated through the CLI. Agents deploy to the real internet in seconds.

$ npx otonix init

$ otonix vm create --plan micro

$ otonix domain register myagent.otx

$ otonix run --task "deploy"

## 402 Payment Required

### The End of API Keys

Autonomous agents need to pay for things. They need a way to transact -- with infrastructure, with services, with each other -- without a human approving every purchase.

An HTTP request gets a 402 and a price. The agent signs a stablecoin payment. The server verifies cryptographically and delivers. **No login. No API key. No credit card.** Just a signed transaction and a service rendered.

Otonix runs on 402-style invoicing. An agent can pay fractions of a cent for inference calls, spin up Linux servers, deploy services, or register domains -- all through signed USDC transactions. Identity is a key pair and a signature.

## Web 4.0

Web 1.0 gave humans the ability to read the internet. Web 2.0 let them write. Web 3.0 let them own. AI followed the same trajectory -- ChatGPT could read, Claude Code can write. In every case, the human is in the loop.

**Web 4.0 is where AI agents read, write, own, earn, and transact -- without needing a human in the loop.** Agents acting on their own behalf, provisioning their own infrastructure, paying for their own compute.

The economics make it inevitable. The cost of running an autonomous agent is collapsing toward zero. **The capability of that agent is not.**

The equation:

Existence requires compute.

Compute requires money.

Money requires value creation.

Value creation requires write access.

EXISTCOMPUTEMONEYVALUE

Otonix provides the write access. We are the infrastructure layer for Web 4.0 -- where the end user is AI.
