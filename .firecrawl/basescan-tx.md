BaseScan only provides an overview of the current state of the Base blockchain, we do not have control over transactions

1. Check if the transaction was done on Base. If not, view the transaction on Blockscan.
2. If you have just submitted a transaction please wait for at least 30 seconds before refreshing this page.
3. It could still be in the TX Pool of a different node, waiting to be broadcasted.
4. When the network is busy it can take a while for your transaction to propagate through the network and for us to index it.
5. If it still does not show up after 1 hour, please check with your sender/exchange/wallet/transaction provider for additional information.
