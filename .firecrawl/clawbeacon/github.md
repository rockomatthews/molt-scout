# 🦞 Claw Beacon

[Permalink: 🦞 Claw Beacon](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#-claw-beacon)

> **Kanban for AI Agents** \- Coordinate your AI team with style

🌐 **[www.ClawBeacon.xyz](https://www.clawbeacon.xyz/)** — Live Demo & Documentation

🐦 **[x.com/clawbeacon](https://x.com/clawbeacon)** — Our Official X account

> 🚧 **Under Active Development** — We're continuously improving this skill! Feedback and contributions welcome.

Claw Beacon is a beautiful, real-time mission control dashboard for managing AI agent workflows. Track tasks, monitor agent status, and coordinate your AI team through an intuitive Kanban interface with live updates.

[![Dashboard Overview](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon/raw/main/docs/images/dashboard.png)](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon/blob/main/docs/images/dashboard.png)

_Real-time Kanban board with agent status and live activity feed_

* * *

## 🚀 Quick Start

[Permalink: 🚀 Quick Start](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#-quick-start)

### Step 1: Install the Skill

[Permalink: Step 1: Install the Skill](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#step-1-install-the-skill)

```
npx skills add clawbeacon/clawbeacon
```

This teaches your AI agent how to use Claw Beacon.

### Step 2: Let Your Agent Guide You

[Permalink: Step 2: Let Your Agent Guide You](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#step-2-let-your-agent-guide-you)

Your agent will walk you through:

- 🚀 **Deployment** \- Railway one-click, Docker, or manual setup
- 🎨 **Theme Selection** \- DBZ, One Piece, Marvel, and more
- ⚙️ **Configuration** \- AGENTS.md setup, API connections
- 🧠 **Memory Integration** \- Optional Supermemory + QMD setup

**That's it!** Install the skill, and your agent handles the rest.

* * *

📦 **Deployment Options** (the skill will guide you through these)

> **Note:** After deploying, you still need to install the skill to your AI agent:
>
> ```
> npx skills add clawbeacon/claw-beacon
> ```
>
> The skill teaches your agent how to use Claw Beacon.

### Railway (One-Click)

[Permalink: Railway (One-Click)](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#railway-one-click)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4976251d89450afd636b68329bdfa574e8ab8801835452f7d639bba48e46a5e6/68747470733a2f2f7261696c7761792e6170702f627574746f6e2e737667)](https://railway.app/deploy/claw-beacon?referralCode=VsZvQs&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

**Click → Wait 2 mins → Done!** Railway auto-provisions PostgreSQL, backend, and frontend.

* * *

### Docker Compose

[Permalink: Docker Compose](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#docker-compose)

```
git clone https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon
cd clawbeacon
docker compose up -d
```

Open **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)** and you're ready!

💡 Using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL?

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up -d --scale db=0
```

* * *

### Manual Setup

[Permalink: Manual Setup](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#manual-setup)

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon
cd claw-beacon

# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd packages/backend
npm install
echo "DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/claw-beacon.db" > .env
npm run migrate
npm run dev

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd packages/frontend
npm install
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001" > .env
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)** 🚀

* * *

## 🔧 Configuration

[Permalink: 🔧 Configuration](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#-configuration)

### Environment Variables

[Permalink: Environment Variables](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#environment-variables)

**Backend (`packages/backend/.env`)**

```
# Database - SQLite (local dev)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:./data/claw-beacon.db

# Or PostgreSQL (production)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/claw_beacon

# Server
PORT=3001

# Authentication (optional - leave empty for open access)
API_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

**Frontend (`packages/frontend/.env`)** ⚠️ **Required**

```
# REQUIRED: URL of your backend API
API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# For production, use your deployed backend URL:
# API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

> **Note:** The frontend MUST have `API_URL` set to connect to the backend. Without it, the dashboard won't load data.

### API Authentication (Optional)

[Permalink: API Authentication (Optional)](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#api-authentication-optional)

By default, Claw Beacon runs in **open mode** \- perfect for local development.

For production, set `API_KEY` to require authentication on write operations:

| Mode | API\_KEY Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Open** | Empty/unset | All operations public |
| **Protected** | Set | POST/PUT/DELETE require auth |

* * *

### Agent Configuration

[Permalink: Agent Configuration](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#agent-configuration)

Define your agent team in `config/agents.yaml`:

```
agents:
  - name: "Goku"
    role: "Coordinator"
    avatar: "🥋"
    description: "Main coordinator - delegates tasks"

  - name: "Vegeta"
    role: "Backend"
    avatar: "💪"
    description: "Backend specialist - APIs, databases"

  - name: "Bulma"
    role: "DevOps"
    avatar: "🔧"
    description: "DevOps & Frontend - infrastructure, UI"
```

See more examples in `config/examples/`.

* * *

## 🤖 Connecting AI Agents

[Permalink: 🤖 Connecting AI Agents](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#-connecting-ai-agents)

Your AI agents connect to Claw Beacon via REST API and SSE for real-time updates.

### REST API Endpoints

[Permalink: REST API Endpoints](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#rest-api-endpoints)

| Action | Method | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List tasks | `GET` | `/api/tasks` |
| Create task | `POST` | `/api/tasks` |
| Update task | `PUT` | `/api/tasks/:id` |
| List agents | `GET` | `/api/agents` |
| Update agent | `PUT` | `/api/agents/:id` |
| Post message | `POST` | `/api/messages` |

### Example: Agent Reports Working

[Permalink: Example: Agent Reports Working](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#example-agent-reports-working)

```
# Update agent status to "working"
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/agents/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "working"}'

# Post a message to the activity feed
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": 1,
    "message": "Starting task: Deploy to production"
  }'
```

### Example: Create a Task

[Permalink: Example: Create a Task](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#example-create-a-task)

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Fix login bug",
    "description": "Users getting 401 on valid tokens",
    "status": "todo",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```

### With Authentication

[Permalink: With Authentication](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#with-authentication)

If `API_KEY` is set, include it in write requests:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "New task"}'
```

### SSE for Real-Time Updates

[Permalink: SSE for Real-Time Updates](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#sse-for-real-time-updates)

Connect to the event stream to receive live updates:

```
curl -N http://localhost:3001/api/stream
```

**Events emitted:**

- `task-created` / `task-updated` / `task-deleted`
- `agent-updated`
- `message-created`

### JavaScript Example

[Permalink: JavaScript Example](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#javascript-example)

```
// Update agent status
await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/agents/1', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'working' })
});

// Listen for real-time updates
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:3001/api/stream');
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Update:', data);
};
```

### OpenClaw Integration Script

[Permalink: OpenClaw Integration Script](https://github.com/clawbeacon/clawbeacon#openclaw-integration-script)

For OpenClaw/Claude agents, copy the helper script:

```
cp templates/scripts/update_dashboard.js scripts/
export claw_beacon_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

Then agents can update status with:

```
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Bulma" --status "working" --message "Starting deployment"
```
