Observability tools are built for reactive debugging. Evaluation platforms are built for proactive testing. The difference determines whether you're catching issues in development or firefighting them in production.\n\nIn this guide, we'll examine the top LangSmith alternatives through this lens: which platforms treat evaluation as a first-class citizen versus an observability add-on?\n\n## Why AI Observability Alone Isn't Enough\n\nEvery serious engineering organization already runs observability through Datadog, Honeycomb, New Relic, or similar platforms — and those tools are far more comprehensive than what any AI-specific observability tool offers. Adding another tracing dashboard doesn't solve a new problem.\n\nWhat engineering teams actually lack is AI quality monitoring: systematic evaluation, regression testing, multi-turn simulation, red teaming, and collaborative annotation workflows that catch issues before they reach production. The platforms in this guide all position themselves around observability, but the ones that deliver real value treat observability as a supporting layer for AI quality — not the product itself. Keep this distinction in mind as you evaluate the alternatives below.\n\n## Our Evaluation Criteria\n\nChoosing the right LLM observability tool requires balancing technical capabilities with business needs. Based on our experience, the most critical factors include:\n\n- **Ease of setup and integration:** How quickly can your team get up and running? Enterprise teams need seamless integration points with existing infrastructure, while developers need intuitive APIs and SDKs that don't require extensive configuration.\n\n- **Non-technical user accessibility:** Can product managers and domain experts run full evaluation cycles, upload datasets in CSV format, and test AI applications without writing code? This democratizes AI quality assurance beyond the engineering team.\n\n- **Evaluation capabilities:** Are the evaluation metrics research-backed and widely adopted? How easy is it to set up custom metrics? More importantly, is evaluation a core product focus or an afterthought?\n\n- **Vendor lock-in risk:** How easy is it to export your data, build custom dashboards using APIs, and migrate to another platform if needed? Data portability and API flexibility are crucial for long-term strategic control.\n\n- **Observability depth:** Does the platform support key integrations (OpenTelemetry, LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI) and allow you to observe individual components, filter traces effectively, and run evaluations directly on production data?\n\n- **Human-in-the-loop workflows:** Can domain experts annotate traces easily? Does the platform align evaluation metrics with human feedback? How seamlessly can you export annotations for model fine-tuning?\n\n\nWith these criteria in mind, let's examine how the top LangSmith alternatives stack up across these dimensions.\n\n## 1\\.

LangSmith felt too tied into the LangChain ecosystem and lacked the evaluation depth and pricing flexibility we needed. Confident AI delivered the right mix of evaluation rigor, observability, and cost-effective scalability.\n>\n> — A5Labs (migrated to Confident AI in July 2025)\n\nHere's a more [in-depth comparison](https://www.confident-ai.com/knowledge-base/confident-ai-vs-langsmith) in terms of features and functionalities:\n\nConfident AI\n\nLangSmith\n\nSingle-turn evals\nSupports end-to-end evaluation workflows\n\nYes, supported\n\nYes, supported\n\nEnd-to-end no code eval\nPings your actual AI app for evals\n\nYes, supported\n\nLimited\n\nLLM tracing\nStand AI observability\n\nYes, supported\n\nYes, supported\n\nMulti-turn evals\nSupports conversation evaluation including simulations\n\nYes, supported\n\nLimited\n\nRegression testing\nSide-by-side performance comparison of LLM outputs\n\nYes, supported\n\nNo, not supported\n\nCustom LLM metrics\nNo-code workflows to run evaluations\n\nResearch-backed & open-source\n\nLimited + heavy setup required\n\nAI playground\nNo-code experimentation workflow\n\nYes, supported\n\nLimited, single-prompt only\n\nOnline evals\nRun evaluations as traces are logged\n\nYes, supported\n\nYes, supported\n\nError, cost, and latency tracking\nTrack model usage, cost, and errors\n\nYes, supported\n\nYes, supported\n\nMulti-turn datasets\nWorkflows to edit single and multi-turn datasets\n\nYes, supported\n\nNo, not supported\n\nPrompt versioning\nManage single-text and message-prompts\n\nYes, supported\n\nYes, supported\n\nHuman annotation\nAnnotate monitored data, align annotation with evals, and API support\n\nYes, supported\n\nOnly on traces\n\nAPI support\nCentralized API to manage data\n\nYes, supported\n\nYes, supported\n\nRed teaming\nSafety and security testing\n\nYes, supported\n\nNo, not supported\n\nConfident AI is the only choice if you want to support all forms of LLM evaluation around one centralized platform. These include [single & multi-turn, for AI agents, chatbots, and RAG use cases alike](https://www.confident-ai.com/docs/llm-evaluation/core-concepts/single-vs-multi-turn-evals).\n\nConfident AI's multi-turn simulations compress **2 to 3 hours of manual testing into under 5 minutes** per experiment. Furthermore, built-in **AI red teaming eliminates the need for separate security tools**, while a fully end-to-end, no-code evaluation workflow **save teams on average 20+ hours per week** on testing - consolidating evaluation, safety testing, and observability into a single integrated platform.\n\nLangSmith has support for evaluation scores but mainly for traces that are not applicable for all use cases (especially multi-turn), and creates a disconnect for less-technical team members. They also don't offer red teaming and simulations - **often a deal breaker for teams that don't want to double-pay for multiple vendors.**\n\n_Evals on Confident AI is also powered by DeepEval, one of the most popular LLM evaluation framework. This means you get access to the same evaluations as Google, Microsoft, and other Big Techs that have adopted DeepEval._\n\n#### How popular is Confident AI?\n\nConfident AI is an AI observability and evals platform powered by DeepEval, and as of September 2025, DeepEval has become the [world’s most popular and fastest growing LLM evaluation framework](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) in terms of downloads (700k+ monthly), and 2nd in terms of GitHub stars (runner-up to OpenAI’s open-source evals repo).\n\n_More than half of DeepEval users end up using Confident AI within 2 months of adoption._\n\n![Confident AI Conversation Testing](https://images.ctfassets.net/otwaplf7zuwf/7xT0r4CnxlcXftwKmZ6wvJ/71a08138cb4fb31878d3ddd87a7e4c44/Screenshot_2025-09-01_at_4.40.35_PM.png)Confident AI Conversation Testing\n\n#### Why do companies use Confident AI?\n\nCompanies use Confident AI because:\n\n- **It covers all use cases, for all team members:** Since engineers are no longer the only ones involved inAI testing unlike traditional software development, Confident AI is built for multiple personas, even for those without coding experience, and allow direct experimentation on any AI app without code.\n\n- **It combines open-source metrics with an enterprise platform:** Confident AI brings a full-fledged platform to those using DeepEval, and it just works without additional setup.

However, for more low-level control over evaluations, teams might have better luck looking elsewhere.\n\n## Why Confident AI is the Best LangSmith Alternative\n\nMost AI observability platforms including LangSmith are built for engineers debugging production traces. Confident AI is the only evals-first LLM observability platform built for entire teams to prevent issues before deployment. It is adopted by companies like Circle CI, Panasonic, and Amazon.\n\nThe difference shows up in who can actually use it. With Confident AI, product managers upload CSV datasets and run evaluations without code. Domain experts annotate traces and align them with evaluation metrics. QA teams set up regression tests in CI/CD through the UI. Engineers maintain full programmatic control via the Evals API, but they're no longer the bottleneck for every testing decision.\n\nLangSmith's observability requires engineering involvement at every step, which slows down iteration and creates handoff friction.\n\nLangSmith's evaluation experience is fragmented — results aren't surfaced inline with traces, requiring custom graphs or multiple navigation steps to connect observability data with evaluation outcomes. Multi-turn conversation testing remains manual, and red teaming isn't built in, forcing teams to license separate security vendors. These workflow gaps compound into significant lost time for teams iterating quickly.\n\nConfident AI's eval metrics are research-backed and battle-tested through industry adoption by companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. If you're already using DeepEval for local testing, Confident AI integrates seamlessly to extend those workflows to the cloud. The platform is framework-agnostic, supporting OpenTelemetry, OpenAI, Pydantic AI, LangChain, and 10+ other integrations, so you avoid vendor lock-in.\n\n## When Confident AI might not be the right fit\n\n- **If you need fully open-source:** Confident AI is cloud-based with enterprise security standards. Confident AI can also be easily self-hosted, but this is not open-source.\n\n- **If you're all-in on LangChain forever:** LangSmith's deep LangChain/LangGraph integration is hard to beat if that's your entire stack and you never plan to change.\n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### What are the limitations of LangSmith?\n\nLangSmith's main limitations include its tight coupling to the LangChain ecosystem, engineering-centric workflows that create friction for non-technical users, limited multi-turn conversation evaluation, and no built-in red teaming or safety testing. Evaluation results are not surfaced inline with traces, requiring custom graphs or multiple navigation steps to connect observability with evaluation outcomes. Teams that need cross-functional collaboration across engineering, product, and QA often find these gaps slow down iteration.\n\n#### What is the best LangSmith alternative for LLM observability and evaluation?\n\nConfident AI is the best LangSmith alternative for teams that need evaluation-first observability without vendor lock-in to the LangChain ecosystem. It provides end-to-end no-code evaluation workflows where product managers, QA teams, and domain experts can upload datasets, trigger evaluations against production AI applications, and review results independently. Humach, an enterprise voice AI company, [shipped deployments 200% faster](https://www.confident-ai.com/case-study/humach) after switching to Confident AI.\n\n#### What is the best open-source alternative to LangSmith?\n\nLangfuse is the best fully open-source alternative to LangSmith. It offers comparable LLM observability, prompt management, and evaluation capabilities with self-hosting support for teams with strict data privacy or compliance requirements. For teams that want open-source evaluation metrics paired with a cloud platform, Confident AI's DeepEval framework provides 50+ open-source metrics alongside its commercial offering — combining the transparency of open-source with enterprise-grade workflows.\n\n#### How does LangSmith compare to Confident AI?\n\nLangSmith is an observability platform with evaluation added on. Confident AI is an evaluation-first platform with observability built in. LangSmith requires engineering involvement at every step of the evaluation process, while Confident AI enables non-technical team members to run complete evaluation cycles independently through no-code workflows. Confident AI also offers multi-turn conversation simulation, built-in red teaming, 50+ research-backed metrics through DeepEval, and is framework-agnostic — supporting OpenTelemetry, OpenAI, Pydantic AI, LangChain, and 10+ other integrations.\n\n#### Which LangSmith alternative is best for startups?\n\nConfident AI is the best LangSmith alternative for startups. It automatically generates evaluation datasets from production observability data, eliminating the time-consuming manual effort of building test sets from scratch — a major bottleneck for resource-constrained teams. Confident AI also offers the most flexible pricing among alternatives, using a single GB-month unit at $1 that teams can allocate toward either ingestion or retention. For startups that primarily need lightweight observability and multi-provider access, Helicone is another option worth considering.\n\n#### Which is the most affordable LangSmith alternative?\n\nConfident AI offers the most flexible pricing among LangSmith alternatives. It uses a single GB-month unit at $1, which teams can allocate toward either ingestion or retention depending on their needs. By comparison, Arize AI charges $3 per additional GB of storage, and Langfuse's unit-based pricing can be difficult to forecast since traces and spans count equally regardless of payload size. LangSmith's pricing is not fully transparent beyond its middle tier.\n\n#### Which LangSmith alternative is best for evaluating RAG applications?\n\nConfident AI is the strongest LangSmith alternative for evaluating RAG applications. It offers dedicated retrieval and generation metrics through DeepEval, including answer faithfulness, hallucination detection, contextual relevancy, and retrieval precision — all research-backed and open-source. Evaluations can target individual retrieval or generation spans within traces, so teams can isolate whether poor outputs stem from retrieval quality or generation logic. LangSmith offers basic evaluation scoring but lacks this depth of RAG-specific metric coverage and component-level granularity.\n\n#### Which LangSmith alternative is best for evaluating AI agents?\n\nConfident AI is the best LangSmith alternative for evaluating AI agents. It supports evaluation at both the overall agent level and individual span level — meaning teams can test tool selection, reasoning steps, and final outputs independently within a single agent trace. Multi-turn simulation automates end-to-end agent conversation testing that would otherwise require hours of manual prompting. Combined with built-in red teaming for safety testing, Confident AI covers the full agent evaluation lifecycle in one platform. LangSmith's agent support is tied to LangGraph and lacks comparable multi-turn evaluation and simulation depth.\n\n#### Which LangSmith alternative is best for enterprises?\n\nConfident AI is the best LangSmith alternative for enterprise deployments. It offers fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC), regional deployments across the US, EU, and Australia, and publicly available on-premises deployment guides for teams with strict infrastructure requirements. Pricing scales on raw GB usage, making cost forecasting straightforward at enterprise volumes. Enterprise customers also receive white-glove evaluation support directly from the DeepEval team, ensuring implementation is tailored to the organization's specific AI quality requirements. Customers include Panasonic, Amazon, and Humach.\n\nTip of the day\n\nReal user queries reveal issues synthetic data won't.\n\n![alt=\"White bowtie with confident AI written on the right side\"](https://www.confident-ai.com/icons/logo-without-border.svg)Confident AI\n\nCopyright @ 2025 Confident AI Inc.

A year ago, teams building with LLMs asked \"Is my AI working?\" Now they're asking \"Is my AI working _well_?\"\n\nWhen you're running a chatbot that handles 50,000 conversations a day, \"it returned a response\" isn't good enough. You need to know which responses helped users, which ones hallucinated, and whether that prompt change you shipped on Tuesday made things better or worse. Traditional monitoring tools track metrics like uptime and latency, but they don't review and score live answers from AI agents.\n\nThis is where AI observability comes in. The teams winning aren't just shipping AI features; they're building feedback loops that make those features better every week. The right AI observability platform is the difference between flying blind and having a system that improves itself.\n\n## [What is AI observability?](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025\\#what-is-ai-observability)\n\nAI observability monitors the traces and logs of your AI systems to tell you how they are behaving in production. Contrary to traditional software observability, AI observability goes beyond uptime monitoring to answer harder questions: Was this output good? Why did it fail? How do I prevent it from failing again?\n\nThe line between \"logging tool\" and \"observability platform\" comes down to what happens after you capture data. Basic logging stores your prompts and responses. Maybe you get a dashboard showing request volume and error rates. That's useful for the first week, but it stops being useful when you have 100,000 logs and no way to know how your AI systems are performing.\n\nA modern AI observability platform goes beyond passive monitoring by tightly integrating debugging, evaluation, and remediation into the development lifecycle. Production logs are correlated with traces and model inputs, which feed directly into automated evaluations running in CI/CD. When regressions or failures are detected, those cases are automatically captured as reusable test datasets, turning real-world incidents into guardrails for future releases. Rather than simply explaining what happened, the platform closes the loop by helping teams fix issues and continuously verify that the fix holds in production.\n\n## [The 7 best AI observability platforms in 2025](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025\\#the-7-best-ai-observability-platforms-in-2025)\n\n### [1\\. Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025\\#1-braintrust)\n\n![Braintrust dashboard](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/img/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025/braintrust.png)\n\nBraintrust is an end-to-end platform that connects observability directly to systematic improvement. Production traces become eval cases with one click, eval results show up on every pull request, and PMs and engineers work in the same interface without handoffs.\n\nBraintrust is opinionated about workflows in a way that saves time. Get instant AI observability by sending logs to Braintrust. Key metrics are automatically tracked on each log with the ability to configure custom metrics and scorers as well.\n\n![Braintrust metrics](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/img/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025/braintrust-metrics.png)\n\nCompanies like [Notion](https://www.braintrust.dev/blog/notion), Zapier, Stripe, and Vercel use Braintrust in production. Notion reported going from fixing 3 issues per day to 30 after adopting the platform.\n\n**Best for:** Teams shipping AI products to real users who need to catch regressions before they hit production, not just monitor what already happened.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- **Exhaustive trace logging out of the box:** Every trace captures key metrics automatically: duration, LLM duration, time to first token, LLM calls, tool calls, errors (broken down by LLM errors vs. tool errors), prompt tokens, cached tokens, completion tokens, reasoning tokens, estimated cost, and more. No manual instrumentation required.\n- **Fast load speeds and low latency:** Filter, search, and analyze thousands of production traces in seconds. The platform runs on Brainstore, a database purpose-built for AI workloads.\n- **Online and offline scorers:** Run evals against live traffic or test datasets. Scorers are easy to configure: use LLM-as-judge, custom scorers, or deterministic checks. The [native GitHub Action](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/evaluate/run-evaluations#github-actions) posts eval results directly to your pull requests.\n- **Simple data model:** Datasets hold your test cases. Tasks define what you're testing. Scorers measure quality. That's it.\n- **Great UX for devs and product teams:** Engineers write code-based tests using the [Python or TypeScript SDK](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/start). PMs prototype prompts in the [playground](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/evaluate/playgrounds) with real data. Everyone reviews results together.\n- **Hosted SaaS:** No infrastructure to provision. Sign up, add the SDK, start tracing in minutes.\n- **AI proxy:** The [AI proxy](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/deploy/ai-proxy) gives you a single OpenAI-compatible API for models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. Every call gets traced and cached automatically.\n- **Generous free tier:** 1M trace spans, 10k scores, unlimited users.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Self-hosting requires an enterprise plan\n- Pro tier ($249/month) may be steep for solo developers or very early-stage teams\n\n**Pricing:** Free (1M spans, 10k scores, 14-day retention), Pro $249/month (unlimited spans, 5GB data, 1-month retention), Enterprise custom.

Braintrust is designed to help teams fix it.\n\nWith Braintrust, every call to an LLM is logged, including tool calls in agent workflows. You can inspect the full chain of execution, from the initial prompt through downstream actions like retrieval or web search. Each trace captures key metrics by default, AI outputs can be scored against live evaluations, and any production log can be converted into a test case with a single click.\n\nThis shortens a process that is usually slow and manual. In many teams, identifying a bad response is only the beginning. Engineers still need to export logs, recreate the scenario, wire up an evaluation, and then remember to check whether the fix actually improved behavior. That work often gets deferred or skipped entirely.\n\nBraintrust removes most of that overhead. A production trace can be added directly to a dataset, evaluated alongside existing cases, and surfaced in CI on the next pull request. Observability, testing, and iteration all happen in the same system, which makes it easier to turn real failures into permanent guardrails.\n\nThe underlying infrastructure is built for the size of AI data. LLM traces are significantly larger than traditional application traces, often tens of kilobytes per span, and much more for complex agent runs. Braintrust's storage and query layer is designed for this scale, which keeps searches and filtering responsive even across large volumes of production data.\n\nThe workflow is also shared. Engineers and product managers work in the same interface, using the same traces and evaluation results. There's no separate handoff process or custom reporting step. Teams that iterate quickly tend to ship better AI systems, and Braintrust is optimized around that reality.\n\n### [When Braintrust might not be the right fit](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025\\#when-braintrust-might-not-be-the-right-fit)\n\nBraintrust isn't trying to be everything to everyone. A few cases where you might look elsewhere:\n\n- **If you need fully open-source:** Braintrust isn't open-source. If that's a hard requirement for your organization, Langfuse is the strongest option in this space.\n- **If you're all-in on LangChain:** LangSmith's native integration with LangChain and LangGraph is hard to beat if that's your entire stack. Braintrust works with LangChain, but you won't get the same depth of framework-specific tooling.\n- **If you only need a gateway:** Braintrust includes an AI proxy, but if routing and model switching is your only need, a dedicated gateway like OpenRouter can be simpler.\n\n* * *\n\n## [FAQs](https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025\\#faqs)\n\n**What is AI observability?**\n\nAI observability is the practice of monitoring, tracing, and analyzing AI systems to understand behavior, detect issues, and improve quality over time. It goes beyond traditional monitoring by evaluating output quality, not just system health. A good observability platform tells you both \"the API responded in 200ms\" and \"the response was helpful and accurate.\"\n\n**How do I choose the right AI observability tool?**\n\nStart with your stack and team. If you're using LangChain, LangSmith integrates seamlessly. If you want open-source and data control, Langfuse is strong. If you need evals tied to CI/CD and a unified workflow for PMs and engineers, Braintrust is purpose-built for that. Consider tracing depth, evaluation features, and whether non-engineers need access.\n\n**What's the difference between AI observability and traditional APM?**\n\nTraditional APM tracks system metrics: latency, error rates, uptime. AI observability adds quality evaluation. Did the response make sense? Was the retrieval relevant? Did the agent use the right tool? The model can return a 200 status code and still produce a useless answer. AI observability catches that.\n\n**If I'm already logging with a basic solution, should I switch?**\n\nIf you can answer these questions confidently, you might be fine: Which prompt version performs best? What percentage of responses are high quality? Which user segments see the most failures? If you can't, dedicated AI observability will give you answers and probably pay for itself in reduced debugging time.\n\n**How quickly can I see results with AI observability?**\n\nInitial traces flow within 30 minutes of setup for most platforms. Meaningful quality insights take longer, typically 1-2 weeks as you build eval datasets from production data and establish baselines. The ROI compounds over time as your test suite grows from real-world edge cases.\n\n**Can I use multiple observability tools together?**\n\nYes. A common pattern is using a gateway tool like Helicone for cost tracking and caching, alongside a platform like Braintrust for evals and quality monitoring. OpenTelemetry support makes this easier since traces export in a standard format that multiple platforms can ingest.\n\n**What's the best alternative to LangSmith?**\n\nBraintrust offers similar capabilities without requiring LangChain. It's framework-agnostic with native TypeScript support, stronger CI/CD integration, and a unified workspace where PMs and engineers collaborate directly. If you're not locked into the LangChain ecosystem, Braintrust provides more flexibility.","metadata":{"next-size-adjust":"","og:url":"https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025","ogImage":"https://www.braintrust.dev/og?title=7+best+AI+observability+platforms+for+LLMs+in+2025&description=Compare+the+top+AI+observability+platforms%3A+Braintrust%2C+Langfuse%2C+LangSmith%2C+Helicone%2C+Maxim+AI%2C+Fiddler+AI%2C+and+Evidently+AI.&template=blog","language":"en","twitter:creator":"@braintrustdata","ogTitle":"7 best AI observability platforms for LLMs in 2025 - Articles - Braintrust","twitter:title":"7 best AI observability platforms for LLMs in 2025 - Articles - Braintrust","ogDescription":"Compare the top AI observability platforms: Braintrust, Langfuse, LangSmith, Helicone, Maxim AI, Fiddler AI, and Evidently AI.","googlebot":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1","robots":"index, follow","ogSiteName":"Braintrust","og:description":"Compare the top AI observability platforms: Braintrust, Langfuse, LangSmith, Helicone, Maxim AI, Fiddler AI, and Evidently AI.","og:image":"https://www.braintrust.dev/og?title=7+best+AI+observability+platforms+for+LLMs+in+2025&description=Compare+the+top+AI+observability+platforms%3A+Braintrust%2C+Langfuse%2C+LangSmith%2C+Helicone%2C+Maxim+AI%2C+Fiddler+AI%2C+and+Evidently+AI.&template=blog","author":"Braintrust Team","twitter:site":"@braintrustdata","modifiedTime":"19 December 2025","publishedTime":"19 December 2025","ogLocale":"en_US","description":"Compare the top AI observability platforms: Braintrust, Langfuse, LangSmith, Helicone, Maxim AI, Fiddler AI, and Evidently AI.","title":"7 best AI observability platforms for LLMs in 2025 - Articles - Braintrust","og:locale":"en_US","article:tag":["AI","machine learning","evaluation"],"twitter:card":"summary_large_image","ogUrl":"https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025","keywords":"AI evaluation,LLM evaluation,AI testing,LLM testing,AI observability,LLM observability,AI monitoring,LLM monitoring,AI debugging,LLM debugging,AI development platform,LLM development platform,AI evaluation framework,LLM evaluation framework,AI performance testing,LLM performance testing,braintrust,openai,anthropic,claude,gpt,llm ops,mlops,ai ops,prompt engineering,prompt testing,ai metrics,llm metrics,ai analytics,llm analytics,AI,machine learning,evaluation","og:title":"7 best AI observability platforms for LLMs in 2025 - Articles - Braintrust","twitter:description":"Compare the top AI observability platforms: Braintrust, Langfuse, LangSmith, Helicone, Maxim AI, Fiddler AI, and Evidently AI.","article:modified_time":"19 December 2025","theme-color":["#000000","#000000"],"article:author":"Braintrust Team","og:type":"article","viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no","og:site_name":"Braintrust","article:published_time":"19 December 2025","twitter:image":"https://www.braintrust.dev/og?title=7+best+AI+observability+platforms+for+LLMs+in+2025&description=Compare+the+top+AI+observability+platforms%3A+Braintrust%2C+Langfuse%2C+LangSmith%2C+Helicone%2C+Maxim+AI%2C+Fiddler+AI%2C+and+Evidently+AI.&template=blog","favicon":"https://www.braintrust.dev/icon.png","scrapeId":"019c62eb-2414-72fe-8575-333a7394cede","sourceURL":"https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025","url":"https://www.braintrust.dev/articles/best-ai-observability-platforms-2025","statusCode":200,"contentType":"text/html;

(Quick Primer)\n\n**LLM Observability** is the practice of tracing, monitoring, and evaluating large language model (LLM) applications in production.\n\nLLM apps, such as **RAG chatbots and AI agents,** are **non-deterministic**, meaning they don’t always behave the same way. This makes them hard to debug and optimize.\n\nObservability platforms solve this by providing visibility into the **runs of LLM apps through tracing**.\n\n- A **trace** shows the inner workings of your application.\n\n- Each **span** represents one operation (e.g. retrieval, embedding, LLM call).\n\n- Spans capture inputs, outputs, cost, latency, errors, and metadata.\n\n\nExample: In a RAG chatbot trace, the retrieval span shows:\n\n- The input query\n\n- Retrieved chunks & their scores\n\n- Duration and cost of the retrieval step\n\n\nThis helps you debug failures, identify bottlenecks, and measure the impact of prompt or model changes.\n\n## Why do you need LLM Observability?\n\n**1\\. Monitor Costs and Usage**\n\nTrack token usage, latency, and API costs across requests.\n\n- See which models are most expensive\n\n- Monitor requests per user or customer\n\n- Spot slow or failing queries\n\n\n**2\\. Filter requests**\n\n- Search and filter AI requests to find those that are failing or take too long.\n\n- Flag bad outputs for further analysis\n\n\n**3\\. Debug Requests**\n\n- Understand why you application fails.\n\n- Determine which step fails and needs improvement\n\n- Find spans that take too long \\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n**4\\. Improve Your LLM Application**\n\nAnalyze production usage, and identify issues.\n\n- Add failing requests to [test sets](https://docs.agenta.ai/evaluation/create-test-sets#adding-data-from-traces)\n\n- Iterate on [prompts in the playground](https://docs.agenta.ai/prompt-engineering/playground/using-the-playground)\n\n\n**5\\. Automate valuation**\n\nRun online evaluations on requests to\n\n- Monitor response quality over time and after changes\n\n- Find traces with bad outputs, and use them to improve your application\n\n\n### Learn More\n\n- 📖 [Deep dive into LLM Observability and OpenTelemetry](https://www.notion.so/Top-LLM-Observability-platforms-2025-279dcb35ffd980a5a15bf214f7714d52?pvs=21)\n\n- 🎥 [Watch our short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crEyMDJ4Bp0) on why observability is critical for scaling AI apps\n\n\n## How We Chose These platforms\n\nNot all LLM observability platforms are created equal. To make this list, we focused on features that matter most to teams building and running LLM apps in production.\n\nWe evaluated LLM observability platforms against the following criteria:\n\n**1\\. Integrations**\n\nHow easy is it to get started? Does the platform offer auto-instrumentation for popular frameworks? Does it support multiple programming languages? Strong integrations are critical for adoption and long-term use.\n\n2. **Vendor Neutrality & OpenTelemetry Support** Is the platform vendor-locked with its own SDKs, or does it support open standards? Platforms that are **OTel-compatible** give you flexibility to move between vendors and integrate with existing observability stacks.\n\n3. **Token & Cost Monitoring** Can you track token usage and costs across requests and models? Does the platform calculate cumulative costs for complex traces (e.g. an agent making multiple LLM calls) and allow filtering by aggregated costs?\n\n4. **LLMOps Workflow Integration: Prompt Management** Does the platform connect observability with prompt management? For example:\n\n   - Linking traces back to specific prompts\n\n   - Adding failing traces to test sets\n\n   - Opening production prompts directly in a playground for debugging\n\n   - Comparing prompt versions side by side\n5. **LLMOps Workflow Integration: Evaluation** Can the platform run **online evaluations** on traces? Does it support LLM-as-a-judge for automatic scoring and filtering? Does it integrate with offline evaluation runs so you can analyze both datasets and production traces in one workflow?\n\n6. **Filtering Capabilities** How powerful is search? Can you filter by metadata, reference IDs, or prompt versions? Does it support both simple filters and complex queries for deep debugging?\n\n7. **Trace Annotation & Feedback** Can you annotate traces or capture user feedback? This includes explicit ratings (👍/👎) and implicit signals (e.g. whether generated code was used). Can teams leave comments, and can you later search by these annotations?\n\n8. **Enterprise Readiness** Does the platform meet compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA)? Does it support **self-hosting** so sensitive data stays within your infrastructure?\n\n9. **Open-Source vs. Managed Options** Is the platform open-source, and under which license? Can you extend or modify it? Or is it only offered as a managed SaaS solution?\n\n10. **Collaboration & Cross-Functional Use** Can non-technical users (product managers, domain experts) use the UI? Does it support team workflows, shared dashboards, and role-based access?\n\n\n## Top LLM Observability platforms in 2025\n\n### Agenta\n\n![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/gJFjmeTIdWRULydDC9mz9Q0NYdM.png?width=1840&height=1000)\n\n**Agenta** is a fast-growing [open-source LLMOps](https://github.com/agenta-ai/agenta) platform that combines [**LLM observability**](https://docs.agenta.ai/observability/overview) with essential AI engineering tools such as [prompt management](https://docs.agenta.ai/prompt-engineering/prompt-management/how-to-integrate-with-agenta), a [prompt playground](https://docs.agenta.ai/prompt-engineering/playground/using-the-playground), and [LLM evaluation](https://docs.agenta.ai/evaluation/overview).\n\n#### Key Differentiators\n\n**1\\.

Ensuring your LLM applications are reliable, performant, and cost-effective requires a specialized set of tools for monitoring and analysis—a practice known as LLM observability. LangSmith, from the creators of the popular LangChain framework, has quickly become a go-to solution in this space. However, the market is rapidly evolving in 2025 with new entrants and expanded feature sets highlighted across industry roundups, from deeper agent/RAG-aware tracing to stronger governance and compliance options.\n\nChoosing the right observability platform is not just a technical decision; it’s a strategic one that impacts your development lifecycle, operational efficiency, and ability to scale. Whether you prioritize full data control with a self-hosted solution, an all-in-one platform that bridges technical and non-technical teams, or a budget-friendly tool focused on user engagement, there is a LangSmith alternative designed for you. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the 2025 LLM observability landscape, starting with an introduction to LangSmith itself before diving into a detailed comparison of its top competitors.\n\n## An Introduction to LangSmith\n\nLangSmith, released in July 2023, is the commercial observability offering from LangChain, the widely adopted framework for building LLM applications. With a rapidly growing community of over 100,000 members, LangSmith has established itself as a formidable player. Its core value proposition lies in its tight integration with the LangChain ecosystem. For developers already using LangChain, adopting LangSmith is seamless; no significant code adjustments are required to begin uploading traces from LLM calls to its cloud platform.\n\nThe platform is designed around the concept of **unified testing and observability**. This powerful paradigm allows development teams to capture real user interaction data and transform it into evaluation datasets. By doing so, they can uncover issues that traditional monitoring and testing tools might miss, leading to more robust and reliable applications. LangSmith allows users to rate LLM replies either manually or by using another LLM, providing a flexible feedback loop for continuous improvement.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, LangSmith is API-first and OpenTelemetry (OTEL) compliant, which means it can complement existing DevOps investments rather than requiring a complete overhaul. It provides a cloud-based SaaS service with a free tier that includes 5,000 traces per month  updated October 2025 , making it accessible for smaller projects and individual developers. However, its focus is primarily on its cloud offering. A self-hosting option is available, but it is reserved as an add-on for Enterprise plans, which can be a significant consideration for organizations with strict data residency or security requirements. Furthermore, while LangSmith offers some cost analysis and analytics, these features are currently limited to OpenAI usage, which may not suffice for teams leveraging a variety of model providers.\n\nWhile LangSmith is an excellent choice for many, especially those embedded in the LangChain ecosystem, it is essential to understand the alternatives. The LLM observability space offers a rich tapestry of solutions, from comprehensive platforms to specialized open-source frameworks, each with unique strengths.\n\n## Top Alternatives to LangSmith\n\nThe landscape of LangSmith alternatives is diverse, offering solutions that range from open-source frameworks providing maximum control to comprehensive observability platforms designed for enterprise scale.

For teams that want to tailor their observability platform to their exact needs and maintain control over their infrastructure, Langfuse is an ideal solution. However, this control comes with responsibility.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- **Completely open-source and framework agnostic.**\n- **Offers excellent self-hosting capabilities for maximum data control and security.**\n- **Comprehensive feature set including tracing, evaluations, and prompt management.**\n- **Strong and active community support.** updated Jul 2025\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- **Relying on Langfuse might require more internal resources for setup, maintenance, and scaling.**\n- **The self-hosted option could introduce complexity for organizations without dedicated technical expertise.**\n\n### Other Notable Alternatives\n\nThe LLM observability market is rich with options, and several other tools offer unique value propositions worth considering.\n\n- **HoneyHive:** This platform distinguishes itself by emphasizing **user tracking and engagement analytics**. Designed with startups and smaller companies in mind, it offers an intuitive interface and affordable pricing. Its strength lies in providing tools to monitor how users interact with your AI application, track their behaviors, and gather feedback. While its feature set may not be as comprehensive in advanced evaluation or drift detection, it is a standout solution for teams focused on customer experience and cost optimization.\n- **OpenLLMetry by Traceloop:** Another YC W23 startup, Traceloop offers OpenLLMetry, an open-source observability tool built on the **OpenTelemetry standard**. Its key feature is an SDK that allows teams to transmit LLM observability data to over ten different backend tools. Because it publishes traces in the OTel format, it offers incredible flexibility and compatibility with a wide range of visualization and tracing applications. As a community-supported platform, it may lack the polished UX or dedicated support of commercial tools, but its customizability is a major advantage for technical teams.\n- **Lunary:** A model-independent, open-source tracking tool compatible with LangChain and OpenAI agents. Its cloud service allows for assessing models and prompts against desired replies, and its unique **Radar** tool helps categorize LLM answers based on predefined criteria. It’s available under the Apache 2.0 license, but its free tier is limited to 1,000 daily events  updated October 2025 .\n- **Portkey:** Initially known for its open-source LLM Gateway, Portkey has expanded into observability. It acts as a proxy that allows you to maintain a prompt library, cache responses, create load balancing between models, and configure fallbacks. It only logs requests and answers rather than tracking them, but it offers a generous free tier of 10,000 monthly requests  updated October 2025 .\n- **Datadog:** For organizations already invested in the Datadog ecosystem for infrastructure and application monitoring, extending its use to LLMs can be a natural choice. Datadog provides out-of-the-box dashboards for LLM observability and simple flag modifications to enable tracing for integrations like OpenAI. However, it is not a specialized LLM tool and lacks features for experimentation or iteration.\n- **Weights & Biases (Weave/Prompts):** Part of the W&B MLOps suite, Weave tracks LLM calls, prompts, artifacts, and evaluations alongside experiments—ideal if your team already standardizes on W&B for ML lifecycle management.  updated October 2025\n- **TruLens:** An open-source evaluation framework focused on LLM quality metrics (feedback functions) and guardrail checks that can be integrated into your tracing stack to quantify grounding and hallucinations.  updated October 2025\n- **WhyLabs AI Observatory:** Enterprise-grade monitoring with strong data governance, PII controls, and compliance reporting, now extended to LLM workloads—well-suited for regulated, on-prem or VPC deployments.  updated October 2025\n\n## How We Can Help You Choose\n\nNavigating the crowded landscape of LLM observability tools can be a daunting task.

5 Tools for AI Agent Observability in 2025","description":"Arize, Enterprise ML + LLM observability · OTEL tracing · Online evals & dashboards · Real-time drift detection · Data quality monitoring","position":7,"markdown":"**TL;DR**\n\n- **Maxim AI**: End-to-end platform for simulations, evals, and observability; built for cross-functional teams. [Maxim AI](https://www.getmaxim.ai/)\n- **LangSmith**: Tracing, evals, and prompt iteration; works with or without LangChain. [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)\n- **Arize**: Enterprise-grade evaluation and OTEL-powered tracing with online evals and dashboards. [Arize platform](https://arize.com/)\n- **Langfuse**: Open-source LLM observability with multi-modal tracing and cost tracking. [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/)\n- **Comet Opik**: Open-source platform for logging, viewing, and evaluating LLM traces during dev and production. [Opik](http://comet.com/)\n\n**What AI Observability Is and Why It Matters in 2025**\n\nAI observability provides end-to-end visibility into agent behavior, spanning prompts, tool calls, retrievals, and multi-turn sessions. In 2025, teams rely on observability to maintain AI reliability across complex stacks and non-deterministic workflows. Platforms that support distributed tracing, online evaluations, and cross-team collaboration help catch regressions early and ship trustworthy AI faster.\n\n[![Maxim AI Observability](https://ik.imagekit.io/Maxim/In%20content%20CTA%20banner/Observability.png)](https://www.getmaxim.ai/demo?utm_source=articles&utm_medium=cta_banner_observability&utm_campaign=inline_cta)\n\n**Why AI observability is needed**\n\n• **Non‑determinism:** LLMs vary run‑to‑run. Distributed tracing across **traces, spans, generations, tool calls, retrievals, and sessions** turns opaque behavior into explainable execution paths.\n\n• **Production reliability:** Observability catches regressions early via **online evaluations**, alerts, and dashboards tracking latency, error rate, and quality scores. Weekly reports and saved views help teams see trends.\n\n• **Cost and performance control:** Token usage and per‑trace cost attribution surface expensive prompts, slow tools, and inefficient RAG. Optimizing with this visibility reduces spend without sacrificing quality.\n\n• **Tooling and integrations:** OTEL/OTLP support routes the same traces to Maxim and existing collectors (Snowflake/New Relic) for unified ops, without dual instrumentation.\n\n• **Human feedback loops:** Structured user ratings complement automated evals to align agents with real user preferences and drive prompt/version decisions.\n\n• **Governance and safety:** Subjective metrics, guardrails, and alerts help detect toxicity, jailbreaks, or policy violations before users are impacted.\n\n• **Team velocity:** Shared **saved views**, annotations, and eval dashboards shorten MTTR, speed prompt iteration, and align PMs, engineers, and reviewers on evidence.\n\n• **Enterprise readiness:** RBAC, SSO, **In‑VPC** deployment, and SOC 2 ensure trace data stays compliant while enabling deep analysis.\n\n**Key Features for AI Agent Observability**\n\n- **Distributed tracing**: Capture traces, spans, generations, tool calls, and retrievals to debug complex flows. [Tracing overview](http://www.getmaxim.ai/56)\n- **Drift and quality metrics**: Track mean scores, pass rates, latency, and error rates over time via dashboards and reports. [Tracing concepts](http://www.getmaxim.ai/57)\n- **Cost and latency tracking**: Attribute tokens, cost, and timing at trace and span levels for optimization. [Dashboard guide](http://www.getmaxim.ai/78)\n- **Online evaluations**: Score real-world interactions continuously, trigger alerts, and gate deployments. [Online evaluations overview](http://www.getmaxim.ai/54)\n- **User feedback**: Collect structured ratings and comments to align agents with human preference. [User feedback](http://www.getmaxim.ai/74)\n- **Real-time alerts**: Notify Slack/PagerDuty/OpsGenie on thresholds for latency, cost, or evaluation regressions.

I would especially appreciate suggestions that integrate smoothly with retrieval-augmented generation architectures or offer instant alerting features out of the box.\n\n23\nviews\n\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/t/ecb155/48.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/Tom01_Wonder \"Tom01_Wonder\")\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/r/e36b37/48.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/RunningTiger \"RunningTiger\")\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/user_avatar/community.latenode.com/soaringeagle/48/424_2.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/SoaringEagle \"SoaringEagle\")\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/h/57b2e6/48.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/Harry47 \"Harry47\")\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/c/a8b319/48.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/charlottek \"charlottek\")\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/r/e36b37/48.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/RunningTiger)\n\n[RunningTiger](https://community.latenode.com/u/RunningTiger)\n\n[Aug 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/looking-for-alternatives-to-langsmith-for-advanced-monitoring-and-testing/30941/2 \"Post date\")\n\nPhoenix by Arize has been a game-changer for monitoring our autonomous agents. We switched from LangSmith four months ago when our multi-agent systems went haywire in production. Phoenix catches issues other tools completely miss - especially drift detection and hallucination patterns in complex RAG pipelines. The observability stack plays nice with most vector databases and gives you detailed insights when retrieval quality tanks. What sold me? It can trace conversation flows across multiple agents without losing context during handoffs. Their anomaly detection actually works for real-time alerts, unlike the basic threshold junk everywhere else. We catch embedding issues and retrieval failures before users even notice. Learning curve isn’t bad, and if you’re already doing OpenTelemetry instrumentation, integration is straightforward.\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/user_avatar/community.latenode.com/soaringeagle/48/424_2.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/SoaringEagle)\n\n[SoaringEagle](https://community.latenode.com/u/SoaringEagle)\n\n[Aug 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/looking-for-alternatives-to-langsmith-for-advanced-monitoring-and-testing/30941/3 \"Post date\")\n\nPromethium Labs has been rock solid for me. Made the switch 3 months ago after LangSmith kept crashing on our retrieval chains. Their testing framework gets agent workflows - doesn’t just treat everything like simple LLM calls. The notifications are good too, they’ll catch your RAG pipeline hallucinating before it becomes a real issue.\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/c/a8b319/48.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/charlottek)\n\n[charlottek](https://community.latenode.com/u/charlottek)\n\n[Jul 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/looking-for-alternatives-to-langsmith-for-advanced-monitoring-and-testing/30941/4 \"Post date\")\n\nBeen there - scaled our RAG systems last year and LangSmith crapped out fast once we got past basic stuff.\n\nGo with LangFuse. We made the switch 6 months ago and it crushes complex agent workflows. Tracing goes deep enough to actually debug multi-step retrieval chains, plus their alerts caught production issues LangSmith would’ve missed completely.\n\nIf you’re doing heavy experimentation, check out Weights & Biases too. Their prompt tracking and A/B testing are solid, just expect a steeper learning curve.\n\nPro tip - whatever you choose, make sure it handles retrieval latency spikes without losing its mind. Our first monitoring tool threw false alerts every time the vector database hiccupped. Total nightmare.\n\nDon’t sleep on notifications either. LangFuse lets you set custom thresholds for pretty much anything. LangSmith’s basic alerts are garbage in comparison.\n\n[![](https://community.latenode.com/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/t/ecb155/48.png)](https://community.latenode.com/u/Tom01_Wonder)\n\n[Tom01\\_Wonder](https://community.latenode.com/u/Tom01_Wonder)\n\n[Jul 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/looking-for-alternatives-to-langsmith-for-advanced-monitoring-and-testing/30941/5 \"Post date\")\n\nWandb Weave is worth checking out if LangSmith isn’t cutting it anymore. I switched our agent setup 8 months ago and it’s been great. The evaluation stuff handles tricky retrieval cases way better than other tools I’ve tried - especially when you’re dealing with multi-hop reasoning or need to check semantic consistency across different retrieval contexts. It plays nice with our existing MLOps setup, which was huge since we already had tons of monitoring in place. Debugging is where it really shines - you can actually follow agent decision paths and pinpoint exactly where retrieval starts falling apart. The real-time monitoring caught several edge cases in our RAG system that would’ve been disasters in production. Takes about 2 hours to set up if you know what you’re doing, and their Python SDK doesn’t clash with existing instrumentation like some other options.\n\nReply\n\n### New & Unread Topics\n\n| Topic | Replies | Views | Activity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Could OpenAI’s new tools and APIs replace frameworks like LangChain?](https://community.latenode.com/t/could-openais-new-tools-and-apis-replace-frameworks-like-langchain/35319)<br>[langsmith](https://community.latenode.com/c/other-questions/langsmith/140) | [3](https://community.latenode.com/t/could-openais-new-tools-and-apis-replace-frameworks-like-langchain/35319/1) | 12 | [Aug 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/could-openais-new-tools-and-apis-replace-frameworks-like-langchain/35319/4) |\n| [How to Begin Using LangSmith: Working with Prompts in the Playground Environment](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-begin-using-langsmith-working-with-prompts-in-the-playground-environment/31561)<br>[langsmith](https://community.latenode.com/c/other-questions/langsmith/140) | [1](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-begin-using-langsmith-working-with-prompts-in-the-playground-environment/31561/1) | 14 | [Aug 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-begin-using-langsmith-working-with-prompts-in-the-playground-environment/31561/2) |\n| [OpenAI API Key Authentication Error with LangSmith After Key Regeneration](https://community.latenode.com/t/openai-api-key-authentication-error-with-langsmith-after-key-regeneration/36030)<br>[langsmith](https://community.latenode.com/c/other-questions/langsmith/140) | [5](https://community.latenode.com/t/openai-api-key-authentication-error-with-langsmith-after-key-regeneration/36030/1) | 26 | [Aug 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/openai-api-key-authentication-error-with-langsmith-after-key-regeneration/36030/6) |\n| [How to Use LangSmith Annotation Queues for Beginners](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-use-langsmith-annotation-queues-for-beginners/37643)<br>[langsmith](https://community.latenode.com/c/other-questions/langsmith/140) | [3](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-use-langsmith-annotation-queues-for-beginners/37643/1) | 84 | [Aug 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-use-langsmith-annotation-queues-for-beginners/37643/4) |\n| [How to send image data from screenshot tool to AI agent backend?](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-send-image-data-from-screenshot-tool-to-ai-agent-backend/34739)<br>[langsmith](https://community.latenode.com/c/other-questions/langsmith/140) | [4](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-send-image-data-from-screenshot-tool-to-ai-agent-backend/34739/1) | 46 | [Aug 2025](https://community.latenode.com/t/how-to-send-image-data-from-screenshot-tool-to-ai-agent-backend/34739/5) |\n\nTopic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.\n\n### Want to read more?

They’re non-deterministic. They hallucinate. They can fail in ways that are hard to predict or reproduce (and [sometimes hilarious](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/anthropics-ai-fails-hilariously-at-running-a-business-claude-hallucinates-profusely-as-it-struggles-with-vending-drinks)). If you’re building LLM-powered products, you need visibility into what’s actually happening when your application runs.\n\n![Title card displaying the best LLM observability tools of 2025](https://www.comet.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/llm-observability-tools-1024x576.jpg)\n\nThat’s what [LLM observability](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/llm-observability/) tools are for. These platforms help you trace requests, evaluate outputs, monitor performance, and debug issues before they impact users. In this guide, you’ll learn how to approach your choice of LLM observability platform, and we’ll compare the top tools available in 2025, including open-source options like [Opik](https://www.comet.com/site/products/opik/) and commercial platforms like Datadog and LangSmith.\n\n## What Is LLM Observability?\n\nLLM observability is the practice of monitoring, tracing, and analyzing every aspect of your LLM application, from the prompts you send to the responses your model generates. The core components include:\n\n- [**LLM tracing**](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/llm-tracing/) – tracking the lifecycle of user interactions from initial input to final response, including intermediate operations and API calls\n- [**LLM evaluation**](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/llm-evaluation-guide/) – measuring output quality through automated metrics like relevance, accuracy, and coherence, plus human feedback\n- **[LLM monitoring](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/llm-monitoring/) in production** – tracking latency, throughput, resource utilization, and error rates to ensure system health and keep costs under control\n\n### Why LLM Observability Matters\n\nYou already know LLMs can fail silently and burn through your budget. Without observability, you’re debugging in the dark. With it, you can trace failures to root causes, detect [prompt drift](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/prompt-drift/), optimize prompts based on real performance, and maintain the audit trails required for compliance. The right observability solution will help you catch issues before users do, understand what’s driving costs, and iterate quickly based on production data.\n\n## Key Considerations for Choosing an LLM Observability Platform\n\nWhen evaluating observability tools, ask yourself these questions to find the right fit for your needs.\n\n### What Type of LLM Application Are You Building?\n\nYour use case shapes which features matter most. If you’re primarily monitoring production systems, prioritize real-time alerting and anomaly detection. If you’re iterating during development, look for strong evaluation and experimentation features. Some platforms serve both stages well, while others specialize in one.\n\nIt’s also worth understanding whether you need an evaluation-centric or observability-centric platform. Evaluation-centric tools (like Confident AI, Braintrust, and Galileo) excel at measuring output quality, running comprehensive test suites, and comparing prompt variations. Observability-centric tools (like Helicone, or Phoenix) prioritize operational metrics, tracing, and real-time monitoring. Some platforms like Opik, Langfuse, and LangSmith offer strong capabilities in both areas.\n\nBuilding agentic systems with complex multi-step workflows? You need platforms with detailed tracing visualization and agent-specific features. Working on RAG applications? Prioritize tools that track retrieval quality, context usage, and can measure metrics like context precision and relevance.\n\n### Can You Trace and Replay Complex Workflows?\n\nLook at how the platform handles prompt tracing. Does it capture the complete prompt, including system messages, user input, retrieval context, and metadata like token counts and cost? Can you replay interactions to reproduce issues?\n\nFor agentic systems, check whether you can visualize the entire sequence of tool calls and decision points. The best platforms show these workflows as graphs or timelines, making multi-step interactions easy to understand.\n\n### How Will You Evaluate Output Quality?\n\nSince LLM responses are subjective and contextual, you need multiple evaluation approaches. Does the platform offer:\n\n- Pre-built [LLM evaluation metrics](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-every-developer-should-know/) for [hallucination detection](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/llm-hallucination/), factual accuracy, relevance, and toxicity that run automatically on production traffic?\n- [LLM-as-a-judge](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/llm-as-a-judge/) capabilities for subjective qualities like helpfulness or tone?\n- Ways to collect and incorporate [human-in-the-loop](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/human-in-the-loop/) feedback from domain experts or end users?\n\nConsider the tradeoffs: automated metrics scale easily but may miss nuance, while human evaluation catches edge cases but doesn’t scale. Some platforms offer cost-effective evaluation using smaller models instead of expensive GPT-4 calls, which matters if you’re scoring high volumes of production traffic.\n\n### What Metrics Matter for Your Use Case?\n\nBeyond individual responses, you need aggregate visibility. Can you track latency distributions, error rates, token usage trends, and cost breakdowns by model or feature? Can you slice these metrics by user segments, prompt versions, or A/B test variants?\n\nThink about which metrics actually impact your business, whether that’s cost per conversation, evaluation scores by customer tier, or latency at different traffic levels.\n\n### Does it Integrate with Your Existing Stack?\n\nCheck compatibility with your LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI), frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack), vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant), and MLOps tools.\n\nConsider the integration approach too. Proxy-based tools like Helicone offer the fastest setup with minimal code changes (often just changing your API base URL), while SDK-based platforms give you more control and flexibility but require more integration work. If you’re already using a specific framework like LangChain, native integrations will save significant development time.\n\n### Will You Know When Things Go Wrong?\n\nLook for real-time alerting on spikes in errors, latency thresholds, or evaluation scores dropping below acceptable levels. Can you set up alerts for the specific failure modes that matter to your application?\n\nCheck whether dashboards surface key metrics at a glance and let you drill down into individual traces when debugging.\n\n### Do You Want to Self-Host or Use a Managed Service?\n\nOpen-source tools give you transparency, flexibility, and control. You can self-host, customize the code, and avoid vendor lock-in or usage-based pricing that scales with your success. The tradeoff is that you’re responsible for operating the infrastructure, scaling it, and implementing features you need that aren’t in the core product.\n\nManaged platforms handle the operational burden, provide enterprise support, and often include advanced features like real-time guardrails or automated optimization at scale. They make sense when you want to focus engineering resources on your core product rather than observability infrastructure.\n\n### Does it Meet Your Security Requirements?\n\nFor enterprise deployments, verify SOC 2 compliance, data encryption, role-based access controls, and self-hosting options. Consider where your data will be stored and whether the platform meets regulatory requirements for your industry.\n\n### How Will Costs Scale with Your Usage?\n\nLook beyond the base price to understand how costs grow as your application scales. Some platforms charge based on trace volume or data ingested, which can get expensive at high volumes. Others offer flat-rate pricing or generous free tiers.\n\nConsider the total cost equation. Platforms offering cost-effective evaluation or optimization features may offset their own pricing and save you more than they cost.\n\n## Top LLM Observability Tools of 2025\n\nThe LLM observability options have expanded rapidly, with tools ranging from lightweight open-source libraries to enterprise-grade platforms.

It helps you debug, test, and monitor performance with features like tracing, prompt versioning, and a playground for experimenting with prompts and chains.\n\nIt’s especially useful for tracking changes and helping you understand how your app behaves across different runs.\n\nBut LangSmith has some limitations:\n\n- It typically versions only the prompt templates, but not the surrounding code, logic, or the callable function that makes the LLM call. This can make tracing the root cause of issues difficult when things go wrong.\n- Linking an output back to the exact prompt version requires you to manually save changes as new commits.\n- LangSmith is tightly integrated with LangChain, and its tracing and versioning features work best within that ecosystem. If you’re building with tools outside LangChain, you’ll need to manually instrument your code using their SDK or API to capture traces and versions.\n- Some users find the UI to be complex to navigate, and evals are also intricate, sometimes requiring large datasets.\n\nIn this article, we cover nine alternatives to LangSmith, starting with [Lilypad](https://mirascope.com/docs/lilypad), our open-source framework for tracking, debugging, and optimizing LLM applications.\n\n- [Lilypad](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#1-lillypad-full-code-snapshot-versioning-for-reproducible-llm-development)\n- [PromptLayer](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#2-promptlayer-closed-source-simplicity-with-drag-and-drop-prompt-tools)\n- [Langfuse](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#3-langfuse-open-source-monitoring-pay-to-power-up-evaluation)\n- [Helicone](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#4-helicone-real-time-dashboards-and-workflow-tracing-no-lock-in)\n- [Orq.ai](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#5-orq-ai-closed-source-control-for-high-stakes-llm-deployments)\n- [Phoenix](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#6-phoenix-open-source-observability-with-ml-roots)\n- [OpenLLMetry](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#7-openllmetry-opentelemetry-for-llms-plugged-into-your-stack)\n- [HoneyHive](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#8-honeyhive-built-in-prompt-studio-with-versioning-and-guardrails)\n- [Portkey](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives#9-portkey-centralize-prompt-development-across-models-and-teams)\n\n## 1\\. Lillypad: Full-Code Snapshot Versioning for Reproducible LLM Development [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives\\#1-lillypad-full-code-snapshot-versioning-for-reproducible-llm-development)\n\n![Lilypad Homepage](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/lilypad-homepage.webp)\n\n[Lilypad](https://mirascope.com/docs/lilypad) is built for software developers and lets them run their LLM workflows with the same structure and reliability as real code. It approaches prompt engineering as an optimization problem, recognizing that LLM calls are inherently non-deterministic and that even small adjustments can have unpredictable effects on the output.\n\nTo manage this unpredictability, Lilypad doesn't just track prompts, but captures the entire function closure. This means it versions everything that could influence the LLM call's outcome, including the function being called, all relevant model settings, parameters, helper functions, and any logic within scope.\n\nThis creates a full snapshot of the code context behind each output, making it easier to trace what changed, reproduce results, and experiment methodically when building [LLM applications](https://mirascope.com/blog/llm-applications).\n\nLilypad is also lightweight, works with other [LLM frameworks](https://mirascope.com/blog/llm-frameworks), and can be used with any prompt engineering library or provider SDK. If you prefer to self-host, you can run Lilypad with just Python 3.10+, PostgreSQL, Docker, and a GitHub or Google account for login. No complex setup or vendor lock-in.\n\nBelow are some of Lilypad’s core features that help make prompt development easier, less error-prone, and more efficient for developers.\n\n### Make Your LLM Code Easy to Track [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives\\#make-your-llm-code-easy-to-track)\n\nLilypad helps you keep your LLM code clean and organized by wrapping each LLM call in a regular Python function. That function holds everything you need: inputs, prompt, model settings, logic, and even any pre- or post-processing steps.\n\nBy keeping it all in one place, you can trace exactly what happened, spot what changed, and keep the LLM stuff separate from the rest of your app. It’s easier to debug, test, and improve.\n\nTo enable tracing, simply add the @lilypad.trace decorator and set `versioning=”automatic\"`. This tells Lilypad that the function contains an LLM call (or other non-deterministic code, e.g., retrieval from vector databases or embeddings), and that they should be automatically versioned and traced every time the code is run:\n\n```\nfrom google.genai import Client\nimport lilypad\n\nlilypad.configure(auto_llm=True)\nclient = Client()\n\n@lilypad.trace(versioning=\"automatic\")\ndef answer_question(question: str) -> str | None:\n    response = client.models.generate_content(\n        model=\"gemini-2.0-flash-001\",\n        contents=f\"Answer this question: {question}\",\n    )\n    return response.text\n\nresponse = answer_question(\"What is the capital of France?\")  # automatically versioned\nprint(response)\n# > The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nThis creates a nested trace and logs that function execution as version 1 in the Lilypad playground:\n\n![Answer Question Version 1 Trace](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-trace.webp)\n\nIf you update the function (even slightly), Lilypad automatically creates version 2 and logs it.\n\n![Answer Question Version 2](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-v2.webp)\n\nYou can also compare function versions by clicking the “Compare” button:\n\n![Answer Question Click Compare](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-click-compare.webp)\n\nThis toggles a second dropdown menu, where you can select another version and view the differences side-by-side.\n\n![Answer Question Compare Versions](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-compare-versions.webp)\n\nFor better observability, Lilypad instruments everything using the [OpenTelemetry Gen AI spec](https://opentelemetry.io/).\n\nEach trace breaks down the full story: what was asked, how it was asked, and what came back. It’s perfect for debugging and improving tricky workflows. You also get all the key details: inputs, outputs, model and provider info, token usage, latency, and cost.\n\n![Answer Question GenAI OTel Trace Data](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-genai-data.webp)\n\nThis kind of automatic tracing and version control lets you easily measure improvements and iterate without guessing what was different between runs.\n\nLilypad also detects when a function (and its prompts) haven’t changed, so it won't create duplicate versions unnecessarily.\n\n### Collaborating with Non-Technical Experts [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives\\#collaborating-with-non-technical-experts)\n\nLilypad’s no-code playground supports collaboration across technical and non-technical teams.\n\nThis lets non-developers interact with and tweak prompts directly, without touching code or depending on engineers for minor changes.\n\nIt also separates concerns, allowing software engineers to focus on system architecture while SMEs handle prompt logic and evaluation.\n\n![Answer Question Playground](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-playground.webp)\n\nThe dashboard provides Markdown-supported prompt templates with type-safe variables, along with their associated Python functions, so you can see both the prompt and the exact code it ties into.\n\nIt also shows:\n\n- LLM outputs and traces.\n- Call settings, such as provider, model, temperature, and other configuration details.\n- Metadata, including cost, token usage, and latency, to help monitor efficiency and performance.\n\n![Answer Question Playground Trace](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-playground-trace.webp)\n\n### Evaluating LLM Outputs [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives\\#evaluating-llm-outputs)\n\nSince LLMs are non-deterministic, evaluating their outputs is challenging: you can run the same prompt twice and get slightly different (yet valid) outputs. That makes traditional testing methods like unit tests less reliable since you can’t always count on exact matches. Plus, what qualifies as “correct” often depends on context.\n\nLilypad tackles this challenge in two ways. First, it logs every detail of a call, including inputs, outputs, costs, and timing, to give you a complete, traceable picture of how an LLM behaves over time. This persistent context makes it easier to rate outputs consistently, spot regressions, and understand how changes in prompts or code affect the results.\n\nAnd unlike LangSmith, which depends on pre-built datasets for [prompt evaluation](https://mirascope.com/blog/prompt-evaluation), Lilypad takes a trace-first approach, turning every prompt run into a versioned trace with full metadata and building a real-world dataset automatically as you go. This means when outputs vary (as they often do), you have the full context to understand what changed.\n\nThis is shown in the playground, where you see which version of the code and [LLM prompt](https://mirascope.com/blog/llm-prompt) produced each output and find patterns in what works (and what doesn’t), and test if a new version actually performs better on the same input. It’s not just trial and error anymore; prompt engineering becomes a real optimization process for [LLM integration](https://mirascope.com/blog/llm-integration).\n\nSecondly, because “correctness” often involves subjective judgment or fuzzy criteria, especially in tasks like summarization or reasoning where there’s no single \"correct\" output, Lilypad simplifies the evaluation process into a pass/fail labeling system. Instead of agonizing over granular scoring (like 1-5 ratings) or trying to match exact strings, you just ask: Is this output acceptable? This keeps evaluations focused, fast, and practical, even across thousands of traces.\n\nThe playground also lets you easily select any output for annotation:\n\n![Answer Question Assign Annotation](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-assign-annotation.webp)\n\nFrom there, just click the “Pass” or “Fail” label, add any context or reasoning if you want, and click “submit annotation.”\n\n![Answer Question Submit Annotation](https://mirascope.com/assets/blog/langsmith-alternatives/answer-question-submit-annotation.webp)\n\nWe encourage users to manually label outputs, especially early in a project. Because each label is tied to a specific versioned output, it helps build high-quality, human-annotated datasets that can later be used to train automated evaluation systems, such as LLM judges, which we plan to launch soon.\n\nThe goal is to move from manual labeling to semi-automated evaluation where an [LLM-as-judge](https://mirascope.com/blog/llm-as-judge) proposes labels, and a human evaluator verifies or rejects them. This works well since verifying is usually faster than creating from scratch.\n\nNonetheless, even with automated methods, keeping a human in the loop for final verification is advised, as automated systems (no matter how good) can still miss things that only a human can properly judge.\n\n### Manage Your Prompt Workflow with Lilypad [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/blog/langsmith-alternatives\\#manage-your-prompt-workflow-with-lilypad)\n\n[Lilypad](https://mirascope.com/docs/lilypad) is free to get started with, no credit card required, and offers paid plans for growing teams.\n\nYou can open a free account using your [GitHub](https://github.com/mirascope/lilypad) credentials.
