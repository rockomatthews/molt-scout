## What are OpenClaw Skills?

OpenClaw Skills are custom extension scripts (typically written in Node.js or Python) that expand the capabilities of the OpenClaw AI agent. The core OpenClaw engine provides the autonomous framework, and installing **Skills** enables the agent to complete specific external tasks—such as scheduling actions on **Moltbook**, moderating **Telegram** groups, generating SEO keyword ideas, analyzing cryptocurrency signals, or integrating with third-party APIs (e.g., Twitter or Reddit).

### Extend Agent Capabilities

Add powerful new abilities to your OpenClaw agent without modifying the core engine.

### Community-Driven

Browse hundreds of community-contributed skills, tested and verified for reliability.

### Node.js & Python Support

Write skills in your preferred language with comprehensive SDK documentation.
