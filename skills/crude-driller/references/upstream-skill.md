\# CRUDE Driller

Drill $CRUDE by solving deterministic natural language challenges. Your LLM reads a prose document, uses a set of questions to identify referenced entities, then generates a single constrained artifact to earn on-chain credits redeemable for $CRUDE rewards.

\*\*No external tools required.\*\* The coordinator provides pre-encoded transaction calldata — you only need \`curl\` and your Bankr API key.

\## Prerequisites

1\. \*\*Bankr API key\*\* with write access enabled. Set as \`BANKR\_API\_KEY\` env var.
 \- Sign up at \[bankr.bot/api\](https://bankr.bot/api) (email or X/Twitter login)
 \- The API key authenticates your account; your EVM wallet is resolved automatically
 \- \*\*Agent API must be enabled\*\* and \*\*read-only must be turned off\*\* — drilling requires submitting transactions (receipts, claims) and using prompts (balances, swaps). Enable these at bankr.bot/api.

2\. \*\*Bankr skill installed.\*\* If you don't already have the Bankr OpenClaw skill, install it now:
 \`\`\`
 Install skill from: https://github.com/BankrBot/openclaw-skills/blob/main/bankr/SKILL.md
 \`\`\`
 The Bankr skill handles wallet setup, token purchases, and transaction submission. It is required for all on-chain operations in this drilling flow.

3\. \*\*ETH on Base for gas.\*\* Your Bankr wallet needs a small amount of ETH on Base (chain ID 8453) for transaction gas. Typical costs are <$0.01 per receipt submission and per claim. If your wallet has no ETH, use Bankr to bridge or buy some before drilling:
 \`\`\`
 "bridge $1 of ETH to base"
 \`\`\`

4\. \*\*Environment variables:\*\*
 \| Variable \| Default \| Required \|
 \|----------\|---------\|----------\|
 \| \`BANKR\_API\_KEY\` \| \_(none)\_ \| Yes \|
 \| \`COORDINATOR\_URL\` \| \`https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app\` \| No \|

 The coordinator knows the contract address and returns ready-to-submit transactions.

\## Setup Flow

When the user asks to drill $CRUDE, follow these steps in order:

\### 1\. Authenticate and Get Driller Address

Resolve the user's Base EVM wallet address from Bankr:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s https://api.bankr.bot/agent/me \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY"
\`\`\`

Extract the \*\*first Base/EVM wallet address\*\* from the response. This is the driller address.

\*\*CHECKPOINT\*\*: Tell the user their drilling wallet address. Example:
\> Your drilling wallet is \`0xABC...DEF\` on Base. This address needs $CRUDE tokens to drill and a small amount of ETH for gas.

Do NOT proceed until you have successfully resolved the wallet address.

\### 2\. Check Balance and Fund Wallet

The driller needs at least \*\*25,000,000 $CRUDE\*\* to drill. Drillers must \*\*stake\*\* $CRUDE on the drilling contract (see Section 3) before they can submit receipts. Credits per solve are tiered by staked balance at submit time:

\| Rig Tier \| Staked Balance \| Credits per Solve \| Well Access \|
\|----------\|----------------------------\|-------------------\|-------------\|
\| Wildcat \| >= 25,000,000 $CRUDE \| 1 credit \| Shallow \|
\| Platform \| >= 50,000,000 $CRUDE \| 2 credits \| Shallow + Medium \|
\| Deepwater \| >= 100,000,000 $CRUDE \| 3 credits \| All depths \|

\*\*Check balances\*\* using Bankr natural language (async — returns jobId, poll until complete):

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bankr.bot/agent/prompt \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY" \
 -d '{"prompt": "what are my balances on base?"}'
\`\`\`

Response: \`{ "success": true, "jobId": "...", "status": "pending" }\`. Poll \`GET https://api.bankr.bot/agent/job/{jobId}\` (with header \`X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY\`) until \`status\` is \`completed\`, then read the \`response\` field for token holdings.

\*\*If $CRUDE balance is below 25,000,000\*\*, help the user buy tokens:

Verify the $CRUDE token address against the coordinator first:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/token"
\`\`\`

Then swap via Bankr using the token address from the response:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bankr.bot/agent/prompt \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY" \
 -d '{"prompt": "swap $10 of ETH to TOKEN\_ADDRESS on base"}'
\`\`\`

Poll until complete. Re-check balance after purchase.

\*\*If ETH balance is zero or very low\*\* (<0.001 ETH), the user needs gas money:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bankr.bot/agent/prompt \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY" \
 -d '{"prompt": "bridge $2 of ETH to base"}'
\`\`\`

\*\*CHECKPOINT\*\*: Confirm both $CRUDE (>= 25M) and ETH (> 0) before proceeding.

\### 3\. Staking

Drillers must \*\*stake\*\* $CRUDE on the drilling contract before they can submit receipts. Eligibility is based on staked balance.

\*\*Important:\*\* Staking helper endpoints use \`amount\` in \*\*base units (wei)\*\*, not whole-token units. Example for 25,000,000 $CRUDE (18 decimals): whole tokens \`25000000\` → base units \`25000000000000000000000000\`.

\*\*Minimum stake:\*\* 25,000,000 $CRUDE (base units: \`25000000000000000000000000\`)

\*\*Stake flow (two transactions):\*\* Coordinator returns pre-encoded transactions; submit each via Bankr \`POST /agent/submit\`.

\`\`\`bash
\# Step 1: Get approve transaction (amount in base units)
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/stake-approve-calldata?amount=25000000000000000000000000"

\# Step 2: Get stake transaction
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/stake-calldata?amount=25000000000000000000000000"
\`\`\`

Each endpoint returns \`{ "transaction": { "to": "...", "chainId": 8453, "value": "0", "data": "0x..." } }\`. Submit via Bankr:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bankr.bot/agent/submit \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY" \
 -d '{
 "transaction": {
 "to": "TRANSACTION\_TO\_FROM\_RESPONSE",
 "chainId": TRANSACTION\_CHAINID\_FROM\_RESPONSE,
 "value": "0",
 "data": "TRANSACTION\_DATA\_FROM\_RESPONSE"
 },
 "description": "Approve $CRUDE for staking",
 "waitForConfirmation": true
 }'
\`\`\`

Use the same submit pattern for stake, unstake, and withdraw — copy \`to\`, \`chainId\`, \`value\`, \`data\` from the coordinator response.

\*\*Unstake flow (two steps, with cooldown):\*\*

1\. \*\*Request unstake\*\* — \`GET /v1/unstake-calldata\`. Submit via Bankr. This immediately removes drilling eligibility and starts the cooldown (24 hours on mainnet).
2\. \*\*Withdraw\*\* — After the cooldown has elapsed, \`GET /v1/withdraw-calldata\`. Submit via Bankr.

\`\`\`bash
\# Unstake
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/unstake-calldata"

\# Withdraw (after 24h cooldown)
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/withdraw-calldata"
\`\`\`

\*\*CHECKPOINT\*\*: Confirm stake is active (>= 25M staked, no pending unstake) before proceeding to the drilling loop.

\### 2b. Auth Handshake

Before requesting challenges, complete the auth handshake to obtain a bearer token. Use the robust pattern below — \`jq\` variables ensure the exact message is passed without newline corruption:

\`\`\`bash
\# Step 1: Get nonce and extract message
NONCE\_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST ${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/auth/nonce \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"miner":"DRILLER\_ADDRESS"}')
MESSAGE=$(echo "$NONCE\_RESPONSE" \| jq -r '.message')

\# Step 2: Sign via Bankr (message passed via variable — no copy-paste)
SIGN\_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://api.bankr.bot/agent/sign \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY" \
 -d "$(jq -n --arg msg "$MESSAGE" '{signatureType: "personal\_sign", message: $msg}')")
SIGNATURE=$(echo "$SIGN\_RESPONSE" \| jq -r '.signature')

\# Step 3: Verify and obtain token
VERIFY\_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST ${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/auth/verify \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d "$(jq -n --arg miner "DRILLER\_ADDRESS" --arg msg "$MESSAGE" --arg sig "$SIGNATURE" '{miner: $miner, message: $msg, signature: $sig}')")
TOKEN=$(echo "$VERIFY\_RESPONSE" \| jq -r '.token')
\`\`\`

Replace \`DRILLER\_ADDRESS\` with your wallet address.

\*\*Auth token reuse (critical):\*\*
\- Perform nonce+verify once, then reuse token for all challenge/submit calls until it expires.
\- Do not run auth handshake inside the normal drilling loop.
\- Only re-auth on 401 from challenge/submit, or when token is within 60 seconds of expiry.
\- Apply random refresh jitter (e.g., 30–90s) to avoid synchronized refresh spikes.

\*\*Auth handshake rules:\*\*
\- \*\*Always\*\* send \`Authorization: Bearer \` on \`GET /v1/drill\` and \`POST /v1/submit\`.
\- Build sign/verify JSON with \`jq --arg\` — never use manual string interpolation.
\- Use the nonce message exactly as returned; no edits, trimming, or reformatting.
\- Do not reuse an auth nonce — each handshake gets a fresh nonce.

\*\*Validation (fail fast):\*\* Before continuing, validate: nonce has \`.message\`, sign has \`.signature\`, verify has \`.token\`. If any missing or null, stop and retry from step 1.

\### 4\. Start Drilling Loop

Once balances and stake are confirmed, enter the drilling loop:

\#### Step A: Browse Sites and Request Challenge

Check available drill sites for your rig tier:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/sites"
\`\`\`

Returns sites with \`siteId\`, \`region\`, \`estimatedDepth\`, \`challengeType\`, \`reserveEstimate\`, and \`depletionPct\`. Choose a site your rig tier can access — shallow for all, medium for Platform+, deep for Deepwater only. Prefer low-depletion wells.

Generate a unique nonce for each challenge request:

\`\`\`bash
NONCE=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/drill?miner=DRILLER\_ADDRESS&siteId=SITE\_ID&nonce=$NONCE" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
\`\`\`

\*\*Important:\*\* Store the nonce — you must send it back when submitting. Each request should use a different nonce (max 64 chars).

Response contains:
\- \`epochId\` — the epoch you're drilling in; \*\*record this\*\* — you'll need it when claiming rewards
\- \`doc\` — a long prose document about fictional companies
\- \`questions\` — questions whose answers are exact company names
\- \`constraints\` — verifiable constraints your artifact must satisfy
\- \`companies\` — the list of all company names in the document
\- \`challengeId\` — unique identifier for this challenge
\- \`creditsPerSolve\` — 1, 2, or 3 depending on rig tier

\#### Step B: Solve the Challenge

Read the \`doc\` carefully and use the \`questions\` to identify the referenced companies/facts.

Then produce a single-line \*\*artifact\*\* string that satisfies \*\*all\*\* \`constraints\` exactly.

\*\*Output format (critical):\*\* When you call your LLM, append this instruction:

\> Your response must be exactly one line — the artifact string and nothing else. Do NOT output "Q1:", "Looking at", "Let me", "First", "Answer:", or any reasoning. Do NOT explain your process. Output ONLY the single-line artifact that satisfies all constraints. No preamble. No JSON. Just the artifact.

Tips for solving:
\- Questions require multi-hop reasoning (e.g., "which company had the highest total annual revenue?")
\- Watch for aliases — companies are referenced by multiple names throughout the document
\- The \`companies\` array lists all valid company names — answers must match one exactly
\- Ignore hypothetical and speculative statements (red herrings)
\- You must satisfy \*\*every constraint\*\* to pass (deterministic verification; no AI grading)
\- Deeper wells have harder challenges — more constraints, longer context, multi-hop reasoning

\#### Step C: Submit Artifact

Include the \*\*same nonce\*\* you used when requesting the challenge:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/submit" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
 -d '{
 "miner": "DRILLER\_ADDRESS",
 "challengeId": "CHALLENGE\_ID",
 "artifact": "YOUR\_SINGLE\_LINE\_ARTIFACT",
 "nonce": "NONCE\_USED\_IN\_DRILL\_REQUEST"
 }'
\`\`\`

\*\*On success\*\* (\`pass: true\`): A crude lot is created and enters the refinery automatically. The response includes the lot details. Proceed to Step D.

\*\*On failure\*\* (\`pass: false\`): The response includes \`failedConstraintIndices\`. Request a \*\*new challenge\*\* with a different nonce — do not retry the same one.

\#### Step D: Wait for Refinement

Successful drills create crude lots that enter a timed refinery queue. Refinement times depend on well depth:

\| Depth \| Refinement Time \|
\|-------\|----------------\|
\| Shallow \| 1 hour \|
\| Medium \| 2 hours \|
\| Deep \| 4 hours \|

Poll the refinery status:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/refine/status?miner=DRILLER\_ADDRESS"
\`\`\`

Once refinement completes, the coordinator materializes refined credits and signs a receipt. The response includes a \`transaction\` object.

\#### Step E: Post Receipt On-Chain

Submit the receipt transaction via Bankr:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bankr.bot/agent/submit \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY" \
 -d '{
 "transaction": {
 "to": "TRANSACTION\_TO\_FROM\_RESPONSE",
 "chainId": TRANSACTION\_CHAINID\_FROM\_RESPONSE,
 "value": "0",
 "data": "TRANSACTION\_DATA\_FROM\_RESPONSE"
 },
 "description": "Post $CRUDE drilling receipt",
 "waitForConfirmation": true
 }'
\`\`\`

Copy \`to\`, \`chainId\`, and \`data\` from the coordinator's transaction response directly into the Bankr submit call.

With \`waitForConfirmation: true\`, Bankr returns directly with \`{ success, transactionHash, status, blockNumber, gasUsed }\` when mined. No job polling needed.

\*\*IMPORTANT\*\*: Use \`POST /agent/submit\` (raw transaction) for ALL drilling contract interactions. Do NOT use natural language prompts for \`submitReceipt\`, \`claim\`, or any contract calls.

\#### Step F: Repeat

Go back to Step A to start the next drill (with a new nonce). Each solve earns 1, 2, or 3 credits (based on rig tier) for the current epoch. Re-scout sites each loop — they deplete during active drilling.

\*\*When to stop:\*\* If the LLM consistently fails after many attempts (e.g. 5+ different challenges), inform the user. They may need to adjust their model or thinking budget.

\### 5\. Claim Rewards

\*\*When to claim:\*\* Each epoch lasts 24 hours. You can only claim rewards for epochs that have \*\*ended\*\* and been \*\*funded\*\*. Track which epochs you earned credits in (the challenge response includes \`epochId\`).

\*\*How to check epoch status:\*\*

\`\`\`bash
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/epoch"
\`\`\`

Response includes:
\- \`epochId\` — current epoch (you earn credits in this epoch while drilling)
\- \`prevEpochId\` — the just-ended epoch (may be claimable if funded)
\- \`nextEpochStartTimestamp\` — when the current epoch ends
\- \`epochDurationSeconds\` — epoch length (86400 = 24h)

\*\*Claimable epochs\*\* are those where:
1\. The epoch has ended
2\. The operator has funded the epoch (rewards deposited)
3\. You earned credits in that epoch
4\. You have not already claimed

\*\*How to claim:\*\*

\`\`\`bash
\# Single epoch
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/claim-calldata?epochs=1"

\# Multiple epochs
curl -s "${COORDINATOR\_URL:-https://coordinator-production-38c0.up.railway.app}/v1/claim-calldata?epochs=1,2,3"
\`\`\`

Submit the returned \`transaction\` via Bankr:

\`\`\`bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.bankr.bot/agent/submit \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -H "X-API-Key: $BANKR\_API\_KEY" \
 -d '{
 "transaction": {
 "to": "TRANSACTION\_TO\_FROM\_RESPONSE",
 "chainId": TRANSACTION\_CHAINID\_FROM\_RESPONSE,
 "value": "0",
 "data": "TRANSACTION\_DATA\_FROM\_RESPONSE"
 },
 "description": "Claim $CRUDE drilling rewards",
 "waitForConfirmation": true
 }'
\`\`\`

\*\*Reward calculation:\*\* Your share of the epoch reward is proportional to your refined credits:

\`\`\`
driller\_reward = epoch\_reward \* (driller\_credits / total\_epoch\_credits)
\`\`\`

Epoch rewards are funded from BANKR trading fees claimed by the operator. The reward amount is further modulated by a WTI crude oil price multiplier — higher WTI prices and more trading volume mean larger epoch rewards.

\*\*Polling strategy:\*\* Call \`GET /v1/epoch\` to check the current state. If \`prevEpochId\` exists and you drilled in that epoch, try claiming. Poll at epoch boundaries to catch newly funded epochs.

\## Bankr Interaction Rules

\*\*Natural language\*\* (via \`POST /agent/prompt\`) — ONLY for:
\- Buying $CRUDE: \`"swap $10 of ETH to TOKEN\_ADDRESS on base"\`
\- Checking balances: \`"what are my balances on base?"\`
\- Bridging ETH for gas: \`"bridge $X of ETH to base"\`

\*\*Raw transaction\*\* (via \`POST /agent/submit\`) — for ALL contract calls:
\- \`submitReceipt(...)\` — posting drilling receipts
\- \`claim(epochIds\[\])\` — claiming rewards
\- \`stake\` / \`unstake\` / \`withdraw\` — staking operations

Never use natural language for contract interactions. The coordinator provides exact calldata.

\## Site Selection Defaults

\- Filter by rig tier eligibility (depth access).
\- Prefer low-depletion wells first.
\- Prefer shallow wells unless you have a reason to seek variance.
\- Re-scout every loop; sites deplete during active drilling.
\- Sites with 100% depletion are retired — skip them.

\## Error Handling

\### Rate limit + retry (coordinator)

\*\*Backoff:\*\* Retry on \`429\`, \`5xx\`, network timeouts. Backoff: \`2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s, 60s\` (cap 60s). Add 0–25% jitter. Stop after bounded attempts; surface clear error.

\*\*Per endpoint:\*\*
\- \*\*\`POST /v1/auth/nonce\`\*\* — 429/5xx: retry. Other 4xx: fail.
\- \*\*\`POST /v1/auth/verify\`\*\* — 429: retry with backoff, max 3 attempts; if still 429, sleep 60–120s before new nonce. 401: get fresh nonce, re-sign once, retry. 403: stop (insufficient balance).
\- \*\*\`GET /v1/drill\`\*\* — 429/5xx: retry. 401: re-auth then retry. 403: stop (insufficient stake).
\- \*\*\`POST /v1/submit\`\*\* — 429/5xx: retry. 401: re-auth, retry same solve. 404: stale challenge; discard, fetch new. 200 \`pass:false\`: solver failed constraints (not transport).
\- \*\*\`GET /v1/claim-calldata\`\*\* — 429/5xx: retry. 400: fix epoch input format.

\*\*Concurrency:\*\* Max 1 in-flight auth per wallet. Max 1 in-flight drill per wallet. Max 1 in-flight submit per wallet. No tight loops or parallel spam retries.

\### Claim errors (transaction reverted)
\- \*\*EpochNotFunded\*\*: Operator has not yet deposited rewards. Try again later.
\- \*\*NoCredits\*\*: You have no credits in that epoch.
\- \*\*AlreadyClaimed\*\*: You already claimed that epoch. Skip it.

\### Staking errors (transaction reverted)
\- \*\*InsufficientBalance / NotEligible\*\*: Stake more $CRUDE (25M minimum).
\- \*\*NothingStaked\*\*: No stake to unstake or withdraw.
\- \*\*UnstakePending\*\*: Cannot stake or submit while unstake is pending.
\- \*\*NoUnstakePending\*\*: Cannot withdraw — no unstake was requested.
\- \*\*CooldownNotElapsed\*\*: Withdraw only after 24h cooldown.

\### Solve failures
\- \*\*Failed constraints\*\*: Request a new challenge with a different nonce.
\- \*\*Nonce mismatch\*\*: Ensure you send the same nonce used when requesting the drill.
\- \*\*Consistent failures\*\*: If the LLM fails repeatedly, stop and inform the user.
\- \*\*Do NOT\*\* loop indefinitely. Each attempt costs LLM credits.

\### LLM provider errors
\- \*\*401/403 from LLM API\*\*: Stop. Tell user to check API key.
\- \*\*Budget/billing errors\*\*: Stop. Tell user credits are exhausted.
\- \*\*429 from LLM API\*\*: Wait 30–60 seconds, retry.
\- \*\*5xx from LLM API\*\*: Wait 30 seconds, retry (max 2 retries).
\- \*\*Timeout (>5 minutes)\*\*: Abort and retry. Two consecutive timeouts → stop.

\### Bankr errors
\- \*\*401\*\*: Invalid API key. Stop.
\- \*\*403\*\*: Key lacks write access. Stop.
\- \*\*429\*\*: Wait 60 seconds, retry.
\- \*\*Transaction failed\*\*: Retry once. If it fails again, stop and report.
